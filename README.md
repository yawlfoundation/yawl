# YAWL (Yet Another Workflow Language)

YAWL is a BPM/Workflow system, based on a concise and powerful modelling language, that handles complex data transformations, and full integration with organizational resources and external Web Services. 

### Major Features
YAWL offers these distinctive features:

* the most powerful process specification language for capturing control-flow dependencies and resourcing requirements.
* native data handling using XML Schema, XPath and XQuery.
* a formal foundation that makes its specifications unambiguous and allows automated verification.
* a service-oriented architecture that provides an environment that can easily be tuned to specific needs.
* YAWL has been developed independent from any commercial interests. It simply aims to be the most powerful language for process specification.
* For its expressiveness, YAWL offers relatively few constructs (compare this e.g. to BPMN!).
* YAWL offers unique support for exception handling, both those that were and those that were not anticipated at design time.
* YAWL offers unique support for dynamic workflow through the Worklets approach. Workflows can thus evolve over time to meet new and changing requirements.
* YAWL aims to be straightforward to deploy. It offers a number of automatic installers and an intuitive graphical design environment.
* YAWL's architecture is Service-oriented and hence one can replace existing components with one's own or extend the environment with newly developed components.
* The YAWL environments supports the automated generation of forms. This is particularly useful for rapid prototyping purposes.
* Tasks in YAWL can be mapped to human participants, Web Services, external applications or to Java classes.
* Through the C-YAWL approach a theory has been developed for the configuration of YAWL models. For more information on process configuration visit [www.processconfiguration.com]
* Simulation support is offered through a link with the [ProM](www.processmining.org) environment. Through this environment it is also possible to conduct post-execution analysis of YAWL processes (e.g. in order to identify bottlenecks).
