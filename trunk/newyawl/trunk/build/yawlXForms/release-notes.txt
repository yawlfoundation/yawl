Release Notes
-----------------
Chiba version 0.9.9
---------------------
Another quality release in preparation of 1.0. Lots of detail problems have been fixed and
the code base has been cleaned up further. Significant cleanups have happened in ChibaServlet and
ChibaAdapter. Some submission and connector issues have been fixed and some new features have been
introduced. Itemset, select/select1 have been reworked and cleaned up. Some patches from our users
have been applied to improve overall usability of the API. For details see changes.txt.

Chiba version 0.9.8
---------------------
The release fixes a bulk of detail problems. Further gaps in XForms conformance have been
closed, namely the support of the Submission module, improved namespace support in XPathes,
basic support for the Range control as well as refinements to Upload handling. The XMLRPC
connectors have been improved and now provide a URIResolver and a SubmissionHandler pair.
As always some tests have been added and dead parts have been removed.

Chiba version 0.9.7
---------------------
This release moves Chiba a huge step forward in direction of full XForms conformance. XML Schema validation
has been fully implemented based on the latest Xerces Schema API, over-fullfilling the Spec. by also providing
full structural validation as an option.

The Adapter layer has been simplified and makes param passing from using application to Chiba and back much
easier. A new Resolver (ContextResolver) allows to access context information.

All missing submission options and protocols have been implemented closing another gap on the feature list (Thanks
to Peter Mikula).

As always a lot of bugs have been fixed and new test cases have been added.

Chiba version 0.9.6
---------------------
This release is a quality release. About 10 bugs have been fixed and dozens of new unit-tests have been added.
Many user issues and practical use-cases have been clarified . Main areas of improvement include action
handling and events, repeat processing and xslt refinement. The schema2xforms builder now also supports inheritence.

More detailed info as always in changes.txt.

Bugs that are still open can be viewed via the projectpage under http://sourceforge.net/projects/chiba.

Chiba version 0.9.5
---------------------
This release finally adds the missing upload control with support for anyURI, base64 and hexBinary
encoding. EXSLT functions now also can be used in Chiba along with the internal XForms functions.
A lot of detail work has been done on the servlet, now allowing parametrisation of form, instances,
css and submission URI. The session-handling during submit has been fixed to preserve the original
session of the request. A bunch of new unit-tests and refinement of the event-processing have also been
added. The ConnectorFactory has been refactored to be an AbstractFactory allowing to plugin different
implementations.

Note: this release contains a first version of the new Schema2XForms builder which uses Xerces instead
of Castor. This first move still has limitations in extending complex user-defined types.   

Chiba version 0.9.4
---------------------
This release fixes a lot of detail problems and contains improvements in the areas event-handling,
connectors and xpath-handling. Besides some new connectors (see changes.txt) itemset is now 
supported in a first simple form (without copy). The servlet now can be configured through the 
initial GET request.

A bunch of new unit tests has been added to ensure proper operation of existing (and coming) features.
Additionally a junit target has been added to the ant script which generates a detailed test report.

Please note that there are still some knows issues:
- the Schema2XForms builder still has namespace problems which will be fixed in an upcoming release
when it will be ported to the Xerces schema API.
- there are some known bugs which are listed on our project page for reference. 


Chiba version 0.9.3
---------------------
This release concentrated on stabilizing the API and fixing some issues occurring with 0.9.2
release. The ChibaBean interface has been improved to allow passing external instances to the 
processor before startup and setting some runtime params. XML Base resolving has also been enabled.
The servlet now takes parameters for instances, css- and xslt-stylesheets. Along with
the bug-fixes we've added a bunch of new test-cases.

The webpages have been included in the distribution and integrated with the sample forms.
Additionally javadoc is now available from the webpage menu.

The standard UI generation stylesheet has been completely reworked and now offers support for
different appearances of groups and repeats along with some CSS classes to style them.

The samples have been converted to xhtml which is now considered the default for XForms
container documents.

Chiba version 0.9.2
---------------------
This release refines the object model and moves Chiba closer to XForms conformance.
The init process has been redone to strictly conform to the spec. Chiba now uses
an annotated DOM object model which associates the XForms semantics to their corres-
ponding DOM Nodes. Significant effort has been taken to improve the overall clarity
of the code. 

First steps in supporting the official XForms test suite have been made. It's now
possible to preset instances through API calls before initing. DOM Events support
has been improved further and now allows to dispatch events to form nodes from the 
outside. The overall API of ChibaBean has been simplified and extended. Lots of
detail improvements have been made. Most significantly the checkbox behaviour has
been fixed and XML Base support has been added. See changes.txt for some other details.

NOTE: JDK1.3 has been dropped in this release in favor of better functional support.
This reduces our maintainance overhead and allows faster development of the XForms
functionality.

Chiba version 0.9.1
---------------------
This release mainly fixes problems with missing libs. The new packaging of JDK 1.4 along
with different binary versions of Tomcat brought some confusions about the required libs.
Besides that the Schema2XForms builder has been corrected to adhere to changed syntax
in some details and some code-cleaning and javadoc fixing has been done.

Chiba version 0.9
---------------------
This release is the first adaptation to the XForms Proposed Recommendation. It implements 
more than 90% of the XForms markup and features DOM event support, full dependency tracking 
and dynamic UI updating for the first time.

The whole object model and package structure have been refactored, cleaned up and the API
has been clarified. Additional interfaces provide a better extensibility and allow to use
the processor in arbitrary environments.

First steps have been made for client-side processing (generated scripts) and advanced
CSS styling. Improvements of the unrolled UI format allow much easier stylesheet authoring.
Package structure has been prepared for distribution of Chiba as a standalone JavaBean.

Chiba version 0.8
---------------------
This release is another step forward to conformance to the XForms Candidate Recommendation.
Besides various fixes, we improved the handling of repeats and the binding resolution which
now works correctly with all binding types.

The Schema2XForms generator has been enhanced and re-integrated into Chiba (Chiba2 will be
removed). You can use it to build complete XForms from XML Schema with an Ant task, so it
can conventiently integrated in your build environment.

The UI generation has been completely redone: all XPath evaluations are done in Java Code
now, so that the task of implementing a custom stylesheet will be significantly eased.

Connector Interfaces for integrating into different environments have been added. There are
Resolvers for loading data from filesystem or Http and it's possible now to send form-data
via SMTP.

Chiba version 0.7
---------------------
This release completes the work started for the preview release. Besides several bugfixes and
further code improvements, in this version XForms validation facilities are put to work (again).
Chiba now handles constraint-, type-, relevant- and required-checking according to the CR, and
recalculations are supported basically. Migration to JXPath has been finished.

Chiba version 0.7 Preview Release
---------------------
The main focus for this release was a general code-cleanup and refactoring of the implementation
and API for easier use and extensibility. The coupling between classes has been reduced and especially
Form processing and UI generation are only loosely coupled now, allowing easier adaption to different
environments.

This version now conforms to the Candidate Recommandation of XForms and implements most of its syntax.

Please note that although this version is considered a major improvement of the code, it does not
reproduce all functionality of the last release by now (therefore Preview Release you know). This is due
to the fact that the whole design changed in some areas and responsibilities have been reshaped.
Most significantly there's no Formbuilder any more. This was heavily bound to the old processor code and
wasn't considered worth refactoring.

Note also, that the validation package is currently out of order, cause it still needs to be migrate
to use JXPath. This will follow shortly with next release.

Please check changes.txt for details about features.

Chiba version 0.6.3
---------------------
Bug fix release.

Some bugs have been fixed and the whole implementation
has moved towards bigger conformance to the current
XForms Working Draft.

This release is also a preparation for the next which
will be a major rework and cleanup of the current API.


Chiba version 0.6.2.1
-------------------
maintainance release which fixes some library problems
in the distributions.

Chiba version 0.6.2
-------------------
This release adds new functionality to the processor and fixes various bugs.
New functionalities include:
- validations and calculations are now possible
- submitInfo has been implemented XForms conform
- multiple models/instances are handled now
- fixes some distribution bugs with missing libraries

Please note that the current version of Formbuilder does not support
the usage of all these features. So, if you like to experiment with  validation
and calculations you have to hand-code this into your forms.

Chiba version 0.6.1
-------------------
Version 0.6.1 is mainly a bug fix, cleanup and performance release.  No
major changes to the API and processing has been done compared to 0.6.
These are the major changes (see ChangeLog for details):

- minor and major bug fixes to numerous to be list here!
- further refactorings (namespace handling)
- cleanup of the config files
- major performance increase, both in formbuilder and the processor
- complete new template and document cache layout
- redone calculations (performance and flexibility)
- i18n redesigned (mostly for performance reasons)


Chiba version 0.6
------------------
Version 0.6 is a significant rework of the 0.5.1 release. Following areas have been improved:
- Codebase has been refactored
- Chiba Forms are now nearly syntax-compliant with the Dezember 2001 Working Draft of XForms.
- a Config class has been added which allows to switch configurations
- Unit-Tests have been rewritten and extended
- reduced size of requests by using ids instead of long instance-pathes
- lots of clarifications in stylesheets and code
- extended/improved CSS class-attribute usage in xforms.xsl
- new Cache for Transformers
