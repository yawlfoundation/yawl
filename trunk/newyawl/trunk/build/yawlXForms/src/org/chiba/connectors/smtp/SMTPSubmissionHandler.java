 *    Artistic License
 *
 *    Preamble
 *
 *    The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that
 *    the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the
 *    package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a
 *    more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.
 *
 *    Definitions:
 *
 *    "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives
 *    of that collection of files created through textual modification.
 *
 *    "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified
 *    in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
 *
 *    "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
 *
 *    "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
 *
 *    "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
 *    charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the
 *    Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the
 *    fee.)
 *
 *    "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees
 *    involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under
 *    the same conditions they received it.
 *
 *    1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this
 *    Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
 *    associated disclaimers.
 *
 *    2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain
 *    or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
 *    Standard Version.
 *
 *    3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a
 *    prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that
 *    you do at least ONE of the following:
 *
 *        a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
 *        Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or
 *        placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the
 *        Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 *
 *        b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 *
 *        c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard
 *        executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each
 *        non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard
 *        Version.
 *
 *        d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 *
 *    4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that
 *    you do at least ONE of the following:
 *
 *        a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with
 *        instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
 *
 *        b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with
 *        your modifications.
 *
 *        c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version
 *        executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
 *        documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions
 *        on where to get the Standard Version.
 *
 *        d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 *
 *    5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge
 *    any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.
 *    However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as
 *    part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this
 *    Package as a product of your own.
 *
 *    6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this
 *    Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever
 *    generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
 *
 *    7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of
 *    this Package.
 *
 *    8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from
 *    this software without specific prior written permission.
 *
 *    9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 *    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

/**
 * The SMTP submission driver serializes and submits instance data over SMTP (internet mail).
 * <p/>
 * Currently, the driver only supports the <code>post</code> submission method and the replace mode <code>none</code>.
 * Support for <code>form-data-post</code> and <code>urlencoded-post</code> as suggested in <a
 * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xforms-20021112#submit-options">11.2 Submission Options</a> is on the way.
 * <p/>
 * The driver requires the additional information about the SMTP server to use, the mail subject, and the sender. This
 * information has to be provided in the query part of the submission's <code>action</code> URI. If you want the driver
 * to authenticate a user with the SMTP server, just provide a <code>username</code> and a <code>password</code>.
 * Support for other mail header fields like <code>cc</code> may be added later.
 * <p/>
 * Be careful when writing the submission's <code>action</code> URI: First, the contents of the query part have to be
 * URL-encoded, then you have to replace all <code>&amp;</code>'s with their corresponding XML entity
 * <code>&amp;amp;</code> in order to keep the XML well-formed.
 * <p/>
 * Here is an illustrating example:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;xforms:submission id='smtp' xforms:action='mailto:nn@nowhere.no?server=smtp.nowhere.no&amp;amp;sender=xforms@nowhere.no&amp;amp;subject=instance%20data'
 * /&gt;
 * </pre>
 * The same example enforcing authentication:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;xforms:submission id='smtp-auth' xforms:action='mailto:nn@nowhere.no?server=smtp.nowhere.no&amp;amp;sender=xforms@nowhere.no&amp;amp;subject=instance%20data&amp;amp;username=xforms&amp;amp;password=shhh'
 * /&gt;
 * </pre>
 * Since mail accounts are personal data, there is no example form demonstrating SMTP submission.
