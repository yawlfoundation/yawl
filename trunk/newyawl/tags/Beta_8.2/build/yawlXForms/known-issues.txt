Version 2.0 RC 1
-------------------------------------
- samples (except actions.xhtml) not adapted to work with empty repeats

non-scripted mode:
- help not supported
- date input not supported
- if multiple select/select1 controls bind to one instance node the value of the control can only be changed by
using the first select/select1 in document.
- there's no implementation for XForms message
- upload not completely functional

scripted mode:
- use of upload breaks the browser history (adds an entry) in scripted mode
- help popups still experimental. Only plain text without tags are supported. Using quotes breaks the popup currently.
- ephemeral and modeless message not supported yet
