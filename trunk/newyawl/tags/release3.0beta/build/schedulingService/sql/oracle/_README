Please follow the following steps to set-up the SCHEDULING database user.


1. 	Download the Oracle 11.2.x database software for the target platform from www.oracle.com 
2. 	Install the Oracle database software. 
	Standard Edition is sufficient, we don't need an Enterprise Edition.
3. 	Create a listener using the Net Configuration Assistant (by default the listener listens to  port 1521, that's OK)
4. 	Create a database using the single byte character set WE8MSWIN1252
5. 	In the script "tablespace.sql" modify the name of the tablespace according to your requirements. Also, 
	ensure the correct directory of the datafile is specified.
6.	In the script "table.sql" change the name of the tablespace to the one you have specified in step #4. Be sure to 
	do this for each table definition.	
7.	In the script "user.sql" specify the password for user SCHEDULING.
8. 	Run the following scripts in the specified order by connecting to the database using the account given in 
	the "user" column of the following table.
