take the time to read the change lists below, and refer to the user manual for more
details.


QUICK START: After installation, start Tomcat and point a browser to
             http://localhost:8080/resourceService


1. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
  * Tomcat 5.5.25 or higher
  * Java 5 (1.5) or higher
                                                     

2. CHANGES IN THIS VERSION
---------------------------

(a) ENGINE & CUSTOM SERVICES:
 * [New] Non-human Resources, which can be assigned for tasks at design time and are
   allocated at run time. Non-human resources do not have a worklist.
 * [New] Secondary Resources, a set of resources that are required so that a task can be
   performed. A task's resources can comprise of one primary (human) resource, who
   receives the task on their worklist at runtime, and zero or more secondary resources
   (human and/or non-human), who don't see the task on a worklist.
 * [New] Calendar Sub-service, a component of the Resource Service, which provides for
   reservation of resources for tasks and to mark resources as available/unavailable
   (holidays, maintenance, etc).
 * [New] Scheduling Service, which interacts with the Resource Service and Calendar to
   manage reservation of resources for activities (one or more tasks in a particular
   case).
 * [New] Documentation can be assigned to a task at design time and shown on worklists at
   runtime. Can be dynamically updated during runtime, and all updates are logged. May
   include some meta-text (date and time inserted) and XQueries against net parameters.
 * [New] Administration forms for non-human resource and calendar management.
 * [New] Plugin classes (allocators, codelets etc) may now be located anywhere on a local
   disk (in one or more places), rather than in the YAWL packages, which saves having to
   copy them in each time YAWL is updated, and allows developers to use their own
   namespaces and package names.
 * [New] Process logging may now be disabled in the Engine and/or Resource Service.
 * [New] Process log for a specification can be now downloaded directly from the
   'Case Mgt' form.
 * [New] All Hibernate interaction statistics may be gathered and retrieved via the API.
   Can be enabled/disabled via web.xml configuration.
 * [New] Added two codelets to discover (i) who completed a previous task; and (ii) who
   someone's supervisor is.
 * [Enhancement] The Codelet framework has been greatly enhanced. They each now run in a
   separate thread, and support shutdown, cancel and resume configurations. They can be
   loaded from an external location, and can toggle persistence on or off. Codelet
   parameters can be retrieved via the API.
 * [Enhancement (issue 406)] task documentation may contain dynamic XQueries against net
   parameters.
 * [Enhancement] The size of the Visualiser's screen window is now configurable.
 * [Enhancement] If the YAWL window/tab is closed in a browser session, then reopened, it
   now redirects to last active page, rather than locking the user out.
 * [Enhancement] Better handling of split and join behaviours during specification
   verification on loading.
 * [Enhancement] Extended the setting of deferred allocation variables (where resources
   for a task are sourced from a net variable at runtime) to accept a CSV list of ids
   (instead of being limiting to just one).
 * [Enhancement (SF3203045)] Date ranges for dynamic form calendar components are now
   configurable via data schema restrictions.
 * [Enhancement] Multiple exception listeners may now be registered.
 * [Enhancement] Specification Schema (to 2.2) to accommodate secondary resources.
 * [Enhancement] In web UI, there are now separate menubars for users and administrators.
 * [Enhancement (issue 401)] List of required data parameters for custom services may now
   include optional parameters.
 * [Enhancement] When a popup message dialog is displayed, focus moves to its OK button
   so that it can be closed by pressing 'Enter'.
 * [Enhancement (issue 408)] Improved duplication detection and error messaging when
   loading specifications.
 * [Enhancement] Added engine shutdown event announcement.
 * [Enhancement] Added functionality for the Engine to redirect a workitem to a service
   other than the one assigned at design time (by default the default worklist service),
   if the service is unavailable, instead of going into limbo.
 * [Enhancement] Added scheduling event announcements to resource gateway server.
 * [Enhancement] Added new process log retrieval methods to Engine and Resource Service
   APIs.
 * [Enhancement] All nodes within each XES trace record are now sorted on timestamp.   
 * [Enhancement] Added admin queue functionality to the workqueue gateway API.
 * [Enhancement] Added JSONP support to ResourceGateway.getXXXXIdentifier methods.
 * [Enhancement] Added support for multiple bindings and filters to LDAPSource.
 * [Enhancement (issue 398)] Added servlet shutdown calls for observer gateways.
 * [Enhancement] On workqueues, timed workitems now show how long before they expire,
   rather than how long since they were created.
 * [Bugfix (issue 431)] misaligned labels on dynamic forms when plain field(s) followed
   one or more growable subpanels.
 * [Bugfix] Verification of nets with one or more empty tasks was falsely reporting an
   error in certain circumstances.
 * [Bugfix] The Resource Service was not being completely reinitialised when 'hot'
   reloaded (ie. without stopping and restarting Tomcat).
 * [Bugfix] In tight checkout-checkin loops, some workitem enablements were
   intermittently being announced twice to services.
 * [Bugfix] Intermittent persistence errors with empty tasks.
 * [Bugfix] On login error, focus was remaining on the login form rather than moving to
   popup dialog.
 * [Bugfix] Specification verification on loading was failing for some pre-2.0
   specifications.
 * [Bugfix] Incorrect error message when loading default client accounts with persistence
   disabled.
 * [Bugfix] Hibernate rollback & session closed errors when persistence is disabled.
 * [Bugfix] Workitem creation NPE when its case id was set manually and was invalidly
   formatted.
 * [Bugfix] Length constraint on field in Resource Service process logs was too short.
 * [Bugfix] Double-clicking Login button caused exception.
 * [Bugfix] Errors when removing some workitem timers from persistence.

   ForceFail not progressing case as expected.

   instance broke progression of parent instance.

   not updating its status.

   originally assigned to a different service but had later been redirected to the
   Resource Service.

   circumstances.
 * [Bugfix (issue 422)] Monitor Service was not refreshing parameters when work item
   status changed from enabled to started.
 * [Bugfix] NPE when restoring a net runner with a null execution status from persistence.
 * [Bugfix] Errors when explicitly disabling persistence in a non-persisting Engine
   instance.
 * [Bugfix] Starting a workitem directly from 'Offered' status via the API was leaving
   dead items on some 'Offered' workqueues in some circumstances.
 * [Bugfix (issue 415)] Popup message dialog sometimes too small to show entire message.
 * [Bugfix] When two versions of the same specification were loaded, each with a
   different data type definition schema, and processes were running for each of them,
   when updating workitem data via the workqueue interface API, the Resource Service was
   confusing which schema belonged to which version.
