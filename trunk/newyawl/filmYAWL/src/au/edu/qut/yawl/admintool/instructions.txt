To be able to use the tool:

- When installing postgres keep postgres as username and enter the password admin or create a user once postgres is installed with these values.
- Create a database called testdb into postgres
Note: If you used different values you can also change the corresponding Strings in the DBconnection.java file

- Copy the JDBC driver of Postgres into the lib folder of Tomcat.
- Copy the folder web into the webapps of Tomcat
- Type http://131.181.70.9:8080/web into your browser and off you go.

It is sometimes handy to check the database for the things you entered.
- Open a command prompt
- go to the directory C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\8.0\bin
- type in psql yawl postgres
- type in the password: admin
- Query the database with select * from <tablename>;
