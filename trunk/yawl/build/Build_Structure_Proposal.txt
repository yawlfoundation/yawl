Rationale:
# Separate the source code for the internal engine from that of each of the plugin web-services
# By splitting up build files based on project there can be a default set of tasks defined in the main and all others in sub files

Proposal:
# Keep the src directory strictly for internal YAWL libraries and compile this directory to a Yawl.jar file
# Have all subprojects as directories under either build/plugins/$PLUGIN_NAME
# Have individual build scripts for each of them, simply referencing dist/yawl.jar or dist/xyz.jar for other subprojects, not copying their source on top
# Within the individual build scripts, or from a main build file such as build.experimental.xml, import and reference the relevant build targets
