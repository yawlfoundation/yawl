Rationale:
# Cleanly separating the internal workings from the specific extras, be they web services or some other form of plugin, will make it less tempting to modify internals to suit a specific project
# By splitting up build files based on project there can be a default set of tasks defined in the main and all others in sub files

Proposal:
# Keep the src directory strictly for internal YAWL libraries and compile this directory to a Yawl.jar file
# Have all subprojects as directories under either build/other/name or under an applicable root directory similar to the usr concept in UNIX
# Have individual build scripts for each of them, simply referencing dist/yawl.jar or dist/xyz.jar for other subprojects, not copying their source on top
# Within the individual build scripts, or from a main build file such as build.experimental.xml, import and reference the relevant build targets
