/**
 * This is just like a HashMap only that all the values are actually sets.
 * When you put in a value, you get back a set which contains that value.
 * Should you add another value that has the same key as the first value, the 
 * value will be added to the set pointed to by the key (so the set should
 * have two values in it now). This is mainly used to group populations of data 
 * into a single key. You can make a tree representation solely using 
 * information from the HashBag.
