/**
 * A Restriction is applied to the values in a DAO to determine which values should
 * be returned. Only those values which fit the restriction should be returned.
 * 
 * It is left to the DAO to determine how to check if the values fit the restriction
 * or not, but the class {@link RestrictionEvaluator} can be used to evaluate a
 * restriction for a single object.
 * 
 * DAOs are not required to support all types of Restriction. If a particular DAO
 * doesn't support a type of restriction, then it should throw an
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
