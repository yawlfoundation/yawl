  *  The wsGateway class acts as a gateway between the Worklet Selection
  *  Service and the external RDREditor. As of this release, the only 
  *  functionality it provides is to trigger a running worklet replacement
  *  due to an addtion to the ruleset (by the editor), but future
  *  implementations may extend this gateway for other purposes.
