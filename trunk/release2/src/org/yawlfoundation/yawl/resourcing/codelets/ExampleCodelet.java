/**
 * A simple codelet example demonstrating usage. Much of the work is done in the
 * abstract ancestor, but of course those base classes do not need to be relied upon -
 * all the work my be done in this class if desired.
 *
 * The Element passed back to the caller of the execute method must contain the results
 * of the execution. It should be constructed as:
 *      <root>
 *         <paramName>paramValue</paramName>
 *         <paramName>paramValue</paramName>
 *         ......
 *      </root>
 *
 * "root" can be called anything; each paramName must be the same as one of the
 * triggering workitem's output parameters.
