Version 0.7.1 24/02/2006
========================
 - ported all logging (except events) to log4j - the worklet 'Logger' 
   class became 'EventLogger'.

 - added methods coonectAsService() and isRegisteredUser() to allow 
   a service to logon to the engine using a specific service logon 
   id & password, rather than the generic admin ones.

 - general code cleanup throughout.

 - BUILD changes:
    - sourced common graphics file for welcome page from build/graphics
      instead of having a copy in the worklet build files.

    - changed log4j properties so that the log file path is replaced 
      with {env.CATALINA_HOME} rather than the static {catalina.home}
      entry in the build.properties file.
