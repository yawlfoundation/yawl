                         YAWL Release 3.0  11/09/2014
                        ==============================

 This is the final version 3.0 release of the YAWL Environment. The primary focus of
 this release has been a complete rewrite of the the YAWL Editor, and so this release
 mainly features enahncements and bugfixes over the 3.0beta release of the Editor.

 Please also note that, from this release, the installers previously known as
 'YAWL4Study' are now simply known as 'YAWL', while 'YAWL Enterprise' (formerly
 'YAWL4Enterprise') now refers to manual installations of YAWL in production
 environments. YAWL comes preconfigured with a built-in H2 database, while YAWL
 Enterprise can be manually configured for a variety of database back-ends. Functionalty
 is equivalent in all version of YAWL.

 The YAWL User Manual has also been rewritten for Release 3.0.

                       ==============================

rewrite of the the YAWL Editor. The 3.0 editor is the next generation editor, with a
number of new features and enhancements, such as:

 * reworked interface with always available properties window

 * drag and drop to open a specification
 * faster analysis and validation
 * simplified validation messages
 * new, simpler data perspective
 * easy multiple instance query definitions

 * new repository that supports storing and reuse of nets, decompositions, data
   definitions and extended attributes
 * a consolidated preferences dialog
 * new, simpler resource perspective
 * 'retain familiar' task resource pattern now works across net boundaries

...and many more. A brief usage guide explaining the new features is included with the
editor, to be read as a supplement to the User Manual until that documentation can be
updated.

For the YAWL engine and services, this release also contains several bug fixes and
enhancements over the 2.3.5 release, so those components should be considered to be
more stable than the previous release.
