                        YAWL Release 3.0 beta  25/03/2014
                       ==============================

This is the version 3.0 beta release of the YAWL Environment. It includes a complete
rewrite of the the YAWL Editor. The 3.0 editor is the next generation editor, with a
number of new features and enhancements, such as:

 * reworked interface with always available properties window
 * faster loading and saving
 * upload and download specifications directly between engine and editor
 * drag and drop to open a specification
 * faster analysis and validation
 * simplified validation messages
 * new, simpler data perspective
 * easy multiple instance query definitions
 * colour-coded data definition and XQuery editors (with partial auto-completion)
 * new repository that supports storing and reuse of nets, decompositions, data
   definitions and extended attributes
 * a consolidated preferences dialog
 * new, simpler resource perspective
 * 'retain familiar' task resource pattern now works across net boundaries

...and many more. A brief usage guide explaining the new features is included with the
editor, to be read as a supplement to the User Manual until that documentation can be
updated.

For the YAWL engine and services, this release also contains several bug fixes and
enhancements over the 2.3.5 release, so those components should be considered to be
more stable than the previous release.

Please take the time to read the change lists below, and refer to the user
manual for more details.
