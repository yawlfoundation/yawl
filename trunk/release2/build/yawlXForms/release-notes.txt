Release Notes
=============

Chiba Web version 2.0.0rc1
--------------------------
Chiba Web now provides a full AJAX interface in addition to the traditional
non-scripted mode. While processing is done on server-side the user-experience
is comparable to a full client-side implementation. The AJAX mode supports
Firefox/Mozilla, IE6 and Safari 2.

Chiba Web 2 is a complete new generation and this release shouldn't be considered
production-ready. RC1 serves the purpose of gathering potential outstanding issues
and preparing the final production release.


Chiba Web version 1.0.0
-----------------------
This is the first release of the Chiba servlet as a standalone package. The source
distributions come complete with a Chiba core installed (a set of jar-files, forms
and resources). Current release contains Chiba version 1.1.1.

Most noteably the ServletAdapter has changed to use a new AbstractChibaAdapter
class which is provided by Chiba core since 1.1.1. Although the refactoring is not
still finished in this area, the current version may be considered a solid iterims state ;)
