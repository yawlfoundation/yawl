# Tomcat details: installation directory and whether the installation should treat
# it as a YAWL-dedicated instance (optimising class-loading by putting all dependency
# JARs in Tomcat's shared lib folder) or an instance shared with other applications
# (packaging all dependency JARs in with each webapp; this *significantly* increases
# the permgen space used by Tomcat, so ensure that enough is defined).
#
# The installation path is only used if there is no CATALINA_HOME environment variable
# defined.
