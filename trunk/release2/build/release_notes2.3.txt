QUICK START: After installation, start Tomcat and point a browser to
             http://localhost:8080/resourceService


1. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
  * Tomcat 5.5.25 or higher
  * Java 6 (1.6) or higher


2. CHANGES IN THIS VERSION
--------------------------
 * [New] Added the Proclet Service and Proclet Editor, which provide support for
   inter-process communication.
 * [New] Completed the addition of the Scheduling Service.
 * [New] Added the Document Store, allowing binary files to be passed as data to/from
   work items and nets.
   [New] Added delayed launching for process instances, to start either after an elapsed
   period or at a later specific date/time.
 * [New] Added support for binary file passing in dynamic forms.
 * [New] Added a new 'Discarded' status for work items that are executing in an (unsound)
   net when it completes - services are notified and status is logged.
 * [New] Added InterfaceBWebsideController#destroy method so that custom services can be
   notified when Tomcat shuts down and take any finalisation actions required.
 * [New] Replaced Derby database in YAWL4Study with H2 - smaller, faster and has better
   support for YAWL datatypes.
 * [New] Added eight new system allocators to resource service.
 * [New] Added new Client and Server classes to the worklet service, so that
   developers can write services and applications that receive event notifications when
   selections occur or exceptions are raised, and can add new rules and raise some
   exceptions externally - see the Technical Manual for more details.

 * [Enhancement] Updated Hibernate to v4.0.1
 * [Enhancement] Changed the default button behaviour of dynamic forms so that an 'enter'
   key press will complete the form rather than cancel it.
 * [Enhancement] Added several new Interface A & B methods.
 * [Enhancement] Added new error page for resource service.
 * [Enhancement] Changed XES log output to better match XES standard.
 * [Enhancement] Tightened CharsetFilter so that it would operate correctly when using
   Jetty, rather than Tomcat.
 * [Enhancement] Added new way in the worklet service for developers to add function
   definitions for use in rule node conditional expressions.
 * [Enhancement] Moved service logon names and passwords to their respective web.xmls
   (rather than having them hard coded).
 * [Enhancement] Added 'taskid' to the process logs, rather than just task name.
 * [Enhancement] Updated/added some 3rd party jars to newest versions.

 * [Bugfix - issue 452]: Changed YEventLogger#getDataTypeID to avoid difficulties with
   different database systems' support for equality querying on long string fields.

 * [Bugfix] 'Dangling' observer gateway threads remained running on Tomcat shutdown.
 * [Bugfix] Double logging in scheduling service.
 * [Bugfix] Org Data form was losing UTF-8 encoding in some scenarios.
 * [Bugfix] Hibernate exception when suspending work items.
 * [Bugfix] adding a client app via the Resource Service stored its password unencrypted
   in the active connections list.
 * [Bugfix] WSInvoker build was missing YSpecVersion.class.
 * [Bugfixes] In worklet service: getting external trigger sets, (exception handling)
   completing a case level worklet compensator, updated some demo specs and their rules.
 * [Bugfix] YEngine#skipWorkItem not correctly handling task output-only parameters of
   complex types missing a default value.
 * [Bugfix] Redirection to default worklist on enabled task rejection failing.
 * [Bugfix] RssFormViewer froze admin web page when browser (Chrome) would not auto-close
   completed form.

 * [Bugfix] Problem saving an asset's subcategory.
 * [Bugfix] Popup message dialog in web forms had misaligned 'top' value following the
   display of very long dynamic forms.
 * [Bugfix] When loading a specification with many xor-splits being synchronised by one
   xor-join, and the join has at least one inflow that does not initialise a local
   variable, the generated verification error message included an incorrect path string.
 * [Bugfix] Autotimer tasks were being added to resource service cache on startup.
 * [Bugfix] Potential bug that could cause indefinite hang on reading a socket connection
   on tomcat shutdown.

 * [Refactor] Throughout the resource and worklet services, and many more.
