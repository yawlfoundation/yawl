# References to separate Engine code needed for the build process. (A separate
# Engine source project setup is therefore required.). All paths
# are relative to the root of this project (i.e. ../.. from this build folder).

# Only projectRoot should need changing from the default, unless you have a
# custom Engine build setup (i.e. not using the default checked out folder
# structure and Ant build).

# projectRoot: the path to the directory holding the Engine build
# libJAR: as part of its Ant compile process, the Engine build creates a JAR of
#         all its code (except for standalone GUI material) in its output
#         directory for use by projects (such as the Editor) using its code
#         directly
# depsLib: the directory holding all the Engine dependencies (some of which the
#          Editor also needs)
