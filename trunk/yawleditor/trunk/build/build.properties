java.target.version=1.6

# If you are using a JDK higher than target version specified above, you must provide
# a copy of that version's runtime (rt.jar) so that the correct bootstrapping classes
# can be applied when compiling. Please enter the path to the required rt.jar here
# *only* if your installed JDK is higher than the specified version above. If you are
# compiling with a same version JDK, this property's value can be left blank.

# References to separate Engine code needed for the build process. (A separate
# Engine source project setup is therefore required.). All paths
# are relative to the root of this project (i.e. ../.. from this build folder).
#
# Only projectRoot should need changing from the default, unless you have a
# custom Engine build setup (i.e. not using the default checked out folder
# structure and Ant build).
#
# projectRoot: the path to the directory holding the Engine build
# lib.jar: as part of its Ant compile process, the Engine build creates a JAR of
#         all its code (except for standalone GUI material) in its output
#         directory for use by projects (such as the Editor) using its code
#         directly
# lib.path: the directory holding all the Engine dependencies (some of which the
#          Editor also needs)
