You can find some sample configuration files in the <code>examples</code>
directory of the ProGuard distribution.

<a name="application">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>A typical application</h3>
To shrink, optimize, and obfuscate the ProGuard application itself, one would
typically create a configuration file <code>proguard.pro</code> and then type:
<pre>
java -jar proguard.jar @proguard.pro
</pre>
<p>

The configuration file would contain the following options:
<pre>
-injars       proguard.jar
-outjars      proguard_out.jar
-libraryjars  &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-printmapping proguard.map
-overloadaggressively
-defaultpackage ''
-allowaccessmodification

-keep public class proguard.ProGuard {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of the <code>&lt;java.home&gt;</code> system property; it is
replaced automatically.
<p>
Also note that the type names are fully specified:
<code>proguard.ProGuard</code> and <code>java.lang.String[]</code>.
<p>
The access modifiers <code>public</code> and <code>static</code> are not
really required in this case, since we know a priori that the specified class
and method have the proper access flags. It just looks more familiar this way.
<p>
We're using the <a
href="usage.html#overloadaggressively"><code>-overloadaggressively</code></a>,
<a href="usage.html#defaultpackage"><code>-defaultpackage</code></a>, and <a
href="usage.html#allowaccessmodification"><code>-allowaccessmodification</code></a>
options to shave off some extra bytes, but we could leave them out as well.
The <a href="usage.html#defaultpackage"><code>-defaultpackage</code></a>
directive moves all classes to the given package, in this case the root
package. Only <code>proguard.ProGuard</code> keeps its original name.
<p>
We're writing out an obfuscation mapping file with <a
href="usage.html#printmapping"><code>-printmapping</code></a>, for
de-obfuscating any stack traces later on, or for incremental obfuscation of
extensions.
<p>
In general, you might need a few additional directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
<a href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, or <a href="#beans">bean
classes</a>. For processing 'simple' applications like ProGuard, that is not
required.

<a name="applet">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>A typical applet</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate the applet
<code>mypackage.MyApplet</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar

-keep public class mypackage.MyApplet
</pre>
<p>
The typical applet methods will be preserved automatically, since
<code>mypackage.MyApplet</code> is an extension of the <code>Applet</code>
class in the library <code>rt.jar</code>.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
<a href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, or <a href="#beans">bean
classes</a>.

<a name="midlet">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>A typical midlet</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate the J2ME midlet
<code>mypackage.MyMIDlet</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/wtk2.1/lib/midpapi20.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/wtk2.1/lib/cldcapi11.jar
-overloadaggressively
-defaultpackage ''
-allowaccessmodification

-keep public class mypackage.MyMIDlet
</pre>
<p>
Note how we're now targeting the J2ME run-time environment of
<code>midpapi20.jar</code> and <code>cldcapi11.jar</code>, instead of the J2SE
run-time environment <code>rt.jar</code>. You can target other J2ME
environments by picking the appropriate jars.
<p>
The typical midlet methods will be preserved automatically, since
<code>mypackage.MyMIDlet</code> is an extension of the <code>MIDlet</code>
class in the library <code>midpapi20.jar</code>.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
<a href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, or <a href="#beans">bean
classes</a>.
<p>
You must preverify your midlets <i>after</i> having processed them, using
J2ME's <code>preverify</code> tool. Because this tool unpacks your processed
jars, you should use ProGuard's <a
href="usage.html#dontusemixedcaseclassnames"><code>-dontusemixedcaseclassnames</code></a>
option on platforms with case-insensitive filing systems, such as Windows.
<p>
Please note the in-depth article <a
href="http://developers.sun.com/techtopics/mobility/midp/ttips/proguard/">"Obfuscating
MIDlet Suites with ProGuard"</a> at <a
href="http://developers.sun.com/">developers.sun.com</a>.

<a name="applications">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>All possible applications in the input jars</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate all public applications in
<code>in.jar</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-printseeds

-keepclasseswithmembers public class * {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of <a
href="usage.html#keepclasseswithmembers"><code>-keepclasseswithmembers</code></a>.
We don't want to preserve all classes, just all classes that have main
methods, and those methods.
<p>
The <a href="usage.html#printseeds"><code>-printseeds</code></a> option prints
out which classes exactly will be preserved, so we know for sure we're getting
what we want.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
<a href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, or <a href="#beans">bean
classes</a>.

<a name="applets">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>All possible applets in the input jars</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate all public applets in
<code>in.jar</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-printseeds

-keep public class * extends java.applet.Applet
</pre>
<p>
We're simply keeping all classes that extend the <code>Applet</code> class.
<p>
Again, the <a href="usage.html#printseeds"><code>-printseeds</code></a> option
prints out which applets exactly will be preserved.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
<a href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, or <a href="#beans">bean
classes</a>.

<a name="midlets">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>All possible midlets in the input jars</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate all public J2ME midlets in
<code>in.jar</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/wtk2.1/lib/midpapi20.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/wtk2.1/lib/cldcapi11.jar
-overloadaggressively
-defaultpackage ''
-allowaccessmodification
-printseeds

-keep public class * extends javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet
</pre>
<p>
We're simply keeping all classes that extend the <code>MIDlet</code> class.
<p>
And again, the <a href="usage.html#printseeds"><code>-printseeds</code></a>
option prints out which midlets exactly will be preserved.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
<a href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, or <a href="#beans">bean
classes</a>.
<p>
You must preverify your midlets <i>after</i> having processed them, using
J2ME's <code>preverify</code> tool. Because this tool unpacks your processed
jars, you should use ProGuard's <a
href="usage.html#dontusemixedcaseclassnames"><code>-dontusemixedcaseclassnames</code></a>
option on platforms with case-insensitive filing systems, such as Windows.

<a name="servlets">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>All possible servlets in the input jars</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate all public servlets in
<code>in.jar</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/servlet/servlet.jar
-printseeds

-keep public class * implements javax.servlet.Servlet
</pre>
<p>
Keeping all servlets is very similar to keeping all applets. The servlet API
is not part of the standard run-time jar, so we're specifying it as a library.
Don't forget to use the right path name.
<p>
We're then keeping all classes that implement the <code>Servlet</code>
interface. We're using the <code>implements</code> keyword because it looks
more familiar in this context, but it is equivalent to <code>extends</code>,
as far as ProGuard is concerned.
<p>
And again, the <a href="usage.html#printseeds"><code>-printseeds</code></a>
option prints out which servlets exactly will be preserved.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
<a href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, or <a href="#beans">bean
classes</a>.

<a name="library">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing a library</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate an entire library, keeping all
public and protected classes and class members, native method names, and
serialization code:
<pre>
-injars       in.jar
-outjars      out.jar
-libraryjars  &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-printmapping out.map

-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile
-keepattributes InnerClasses,SourceFile,LineNumberTable,Deprecated,
                Signature,*Annotation*,EnclosingMethod

-keep public class * {
    public protected *;
}

-keepclassmembernames class * {
    java.lang.Class class$(java.lang.String);
    java.lang.Class class$(java.lang.String, boolean);
}

-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {
    native &lt;methods&gt;;
}

-keepclassmembers class * extends java.lang.Enum {
    public static **[] values();
    public static ** valueOf(java.lang.String);
}

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>
This configuration should preserve everything we'll ever want to access in the
library. Only if there are any other non-public classes or methods that are
invoked dynamically, they should be specified using additional <a
href="usage.html#keep"><code>-keep</code></a> directives.
<p>
The <a
href="usage.html#keepclassmembernames"><code>-keepclassmembernames</code></a>
directive for the <code>class$</code> methods is not strictly necessary. These
methods are inserted by the <code>javac</code> compiler and the
<code>jikes</code> compiler respectively, to implement the <code>.class</code>
construct. ProGuard will automatically detect them and deal with them, even
when their names have been obfuscated. However, older versions of ProGuard and
other obfuscators may rely on the original method names. It may therefore be
helpful to preserve them, in case these other obfuscators are ever used for
further obfuscation of the library.
<p>
We've added some directives for keeping the "Deprecated" attribute, for
producing <a href="#stacktrace">useful stack traces</a>, and for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#enumerations">enumerations</a>,
<a href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, and <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>, which are all discussed in their
respective examples.
<p>
The "InnerClasses" attribute (or more precisely, its source name part) has to
be preserved as well, for any inner classes that can be referenced from
outside the library. The <code>javac</code> compiler would be unable to find
the inner classes otherwise.
<p>
The "Signature" attribute is required to be able to access generic types when
compiling in JDK 5.0.

<a name="native">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing native methods</h3>
If your application, applet, servlet, library, etc., contains native methods,
you'll want to preserve their names and their classes' names, so they can
still be linked to the native library. The following additional option will
ensure that:
<pre>
-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {
    native &lt;methods&gt;;
}
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of <a
href="usage.html#keepclasseswithmembernames"><code>-keepclasseswithmembernames</code></a>.
We don't want to preserve all classes or all native methods; we just want to
keep the relevant names from being obfuscated.
<p>
ProGuard doesn't have your native code, so it can't automatically preserve the
classes or class members that are invoked by the native code. These are entry
points, which you'll have to specify explicitly.

<a name="enumerations">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing enumeration classes</h3>
If your application, applet, servlet, library, etc., contains enumeration
classes, you'll have to preserve some special methods. Enumerations were
introduced in JDK 5.0. The java compiler translates enumerations into classes
with a special structure. Notably, the classes contain implementations of some
static methods that the run-time environment accesses by introspection (Isn't
that just grand? Introspection is the self-modifying code of a new
generation). You have to specify these explicitly, to make sure they aren't
removed or obfuscated:
<pre>
-keepclassmembers class * extends java.lang.Enum {
    public static **[] values();
    public static ** valueOf(java.lang.String);
}
</pre>

<a name="serializable">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing serializable classes</h3>
More complex applications, applets, servlets, libraries, etc., may contain
classes that are serialized. Depending on the way in which they are used, they
may require special attention:
<ul>

<li>Often, serialization is simply a means of transporting data, without
    long-term storage. Classes that are shrunk and obfuscated should then
    continue to function fine with the following additional directives:

<pre>
-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>

    The <a
    href="usage.html#keepclassmembers"><code>-keepclassmembers</code></a>
    option makes sure that any serialization methods are kept. By using this
    directive instead of the basic <code>-keep</code> directive, we're not
    forcing preservation of <i>all</i> serializable classes, just preservation
    of the listed members of classes that are actually used.
    <p>

<li>Sometimes, the serialized data are stored, and read back later into newer
    versions of the serializable classes. One then has to take care the classes
    remain compatible with their unprocessed versions and with future
    processed versions. In such cases, the relevant classes will most likely
    have <code>serialVersionUID</code> fields. The following directives should
    then be sufficient to ensure compatibility over time:

<pre>
-keepnames class * implements java.io.Serializable

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    !static !transient &lt;fields&gt;;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>

    The <code>serialVersionUID</code> line makes sure that field is preserved.
    The <code>&lt;fields&gt;</code> line preserves all non-static,
    non-transient fields, with their original names. The introspection of the
    serialization process and the de-serialization process will then find
    consistent names.

<li>Occasionally, the serialized data have to remain compatible, but the
    classes involved lack <code>serialVersionUID</code> fields. I imagine the
    original code will then be hard to maintain, since the serial version UID
    is then computed from a list of features the serializable class. Changing
    the class ever so slightly may change the computed serial version UID. The
    list of features is specified in the chapter on <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/serialization/spec/class.html#wp4100">Stream
    Unique Identifiers</a> of Sun's <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/serialization/">Object
    Serialization Guide</a>. The following directives should at least
    partially ensure compatibility with the original classes

<pre>
-keepnames class * implements java.io.Serializable

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    !static !transient &lt;fields&gt;;
    !private &lt;fields&gt;;
    !private &lt;methods&gt;;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>

    The new directives force preservation of the elements involved in the UID
    computation. In addition, the user will have to manually specify all
    interfaces of the serializable classes (using something like "<code>-keep
    interface MyInterface</code>"), since these names are also used when
    computing the UID. A fast but sub-optimal alternative would be simply
    keeping all interfaces with "<code>-keep interface *</code>".

</ul>
<p>

Note that the above directives may preserve more classes and class members
than strictly necessary. For instance, a large number of classes may implement
the <code>Serialization</code> interface, yet only a small number may actually
ever be serialized. Knowing your application and tuning the configuration
often produces more compact results.

<a name="beans">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing bean classes</h3>
If your application, applet, servlet, library, etc., uses extensive
introspection on bean classes to find bean editor classes, or getter and
setter methods, then configuration may become laborious. There's not much else
you can do than making sure the bean class names, or the getter and setter
names don't change. For instance:
<pre>
-keep public class mypackage.MyBean {
    public void setMyProperty(int);
    public int getMyProperty();
}

-keep public class mypackage.MyBeanEditor
</pre>
<p>
If there are too many elements to list explicitly, wildcards in class names
and method signatures might be helpful. This example encompasses a wide range
of setters and getters:
<pre>
-keep class mybeans.** {
    void set*(%);
    void set*(**);
    void set*(%[]);
    void set*(**[]);
    void set*(int, %);
    void set*(int, **);

    %    get*();
    **   get*();
    %[]  get*();
    **[] get*();
    %    get*(int);
    **   get*(int);
}
</pre>
<p>
The '<code>%</code>' wildcard matches any primitive type, while the
'<code>**</code>' wildcard matches any class name. Array types  have to be
specified explicitly. This results in a short list of alternative method
signatures.

<a name="annotations">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing annotations</h3>
As of JDK 5.0, class files can contain annotations. Annotations are
represented by attributes that have no direct effect on the execution of the
code. However, their values can be retrieved through introspection, allowing
developers to adapt the execution behavior accordingly. By default, ProGuard
treats annotation attributes as optional, and removes them in the obfuscation
step. If they are required, you'll have to specify this explicitly:
<pre>
-keepattributes *Annotation*
</pre>
<p>
For brevity, we're specifying a wildcarded attribute name, which will match
<code>RuntimeVisibleAnnotations</code>,
<code>RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations</code>,
<code>RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations</code>,
<code>RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations</code>, and
<code>AnnotationDefault</code>. Depending on the purpose of the processed
code, you could refine this selection, for instance not keeping the run-time
invisible annotations (which are only used at compile-time).
<p>
Some code may make further use of introspection to figure out the enclosing
methods of anonymous inner classes. In that case, the corresponding attribute
has to be preserved as well:
<pre>
-keepattributes EnclosingMethod
</pre>

<a name="database">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing database drivers</h3>
Database drivers are implementations of the <code>Driver</code> interface.
Since they are often created dynamically, you may want to preserve any
implementations that you are processing as entry points:
<pre>
-keep class * implements java.sql.Driver
</pre>
<p>
This directive also gets rid of the note that ProGuard prints out about
<code>(java.sql.Driver)Class.forName</code> constructs, if you are
instantiating a driver in your code (without necessarily implementing any
drivers yourself).

<a name="componentui">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing ComponentUI classes</h3>
Swing UI look and feels are implemented as extensions of the
<code>ComponentUI</code> class. For some reason, these have to contain a
static method <code>createUI</code>, which the Swing API invokes using
introspection. You should therefore always preserve the method as an entry
point, for instance like this:
<pre>
-keep class * extends javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI {
    public static javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI createUI(javax.swing.JComponent);
}
</pre>
<p>
This directive also keeps the classes themselves.

<a name="rmi">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing RMI code</h3>
Reportedly, the easiest way to handle RMI code is to process the code with
ProGuard first and then invoke the <code>rmic</code> tool. If that is not
possible, you may want to try something like this:
<pre>
-keep interface * extends java.rmi.Remote {
    &lt;methods&gt;;
}

-keep class * implements java.rmi.Remote {
    &lt;init&gt;(java.rmi.activation.ActivationID, java.rmi.MarshalledObject);
}
</pre>
<p>
The first directive keeps all your Remote interfaces and their methods. The
second one keeps all the implementations, along with their particular RMI
constructors, if any.

<a name="stacktrace">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Producing useful obfuscated stack traces</h3>
These options let obfuscated applications or libraries produce stack traces
that can still be deciphered later on:
<pre>
-printmapping out.map

-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable
</pre>
<p>
We're keeping all source file attributes, but we're replacing their values by
the string "SourceFile". We could use any string. This string is already
present in all class files, so it doesn't take up any extra space. If you're
working with J++, you'll want to keep the "SourceDir" attribute as well.
<p>
We're also keeping the line number tables of all methods.
<p>
Whenever both of these attributes are present, the Java run-time environment
will include line number information when printing out exception stack traces.
<p>
The information will only be useful if we can map the obfuscated names back to
their original names, so we're saving the mapping to a file
<code>out.map</code>. The information can then be used by the <a
href="retrace/index.html">ReTrace</a> tool to restore the original stack trace.

<a name="restructuring">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Restructuring the output archives</h3>
In simple applications, all output classes and resources files are merged into
a single jar. For example:
<pre>
-injars  classes
-injars  in1.jar
-injars  in2.jar
-injars  in3.jar
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration merges the processed versions of the files in the
<code>classes</code> directory and the three jars into a single output jar
<code>out.jar</code>.
<p>
If you want to preserve the structure of your input jars (and/or wars, ears,
zips, or directories), you can specify an output directory (or a war, an ear,
or a zip). For example:
<pre>
-injars  in1.jar
-injars  in2.jar
-injars  in3.jar
-outjars out
</pre>
<p>
The input jars will then be reconstructed in the directory <code>out</code>,
with their original names.
<p>
You can also combine archives into higher level archives. For example:
<pre>
-injars  in1.jar
-injars  in2.jar
-injars  in3.jar
-outjars out.war
</pre>
<p>
The other way around, you can flatten the archives inside higher level
archives into simple archives:
<pre>
-injars  in.war
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration puts the processed contents of all jars inside
<code>in.war</code> (plus any other contents of <code>in.war</code>) into
<code>out.jar</code>.
<p>
If you want to combine input jars (and/or wars, ears, zips, or directories)
into output jars (and/or wars, ears, zips, or directories), you can group the
<a href="usage.html#injars"><code>-injars</code></a> and <a
href="usage.html#outjars"><code>-outjars</code></a> options. For example:
<pre>
-injars base_in1.jar
-injars base_in2.jar
-injars base_in3.jar
-outjars base_out.jar

-injars  extra_in.jar
-outjars extra_out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration puts the processed results of all <code>base_in*.jar</code>
jars into <code>base_out.jar</code>, and the processed results of the
<code>extra_in.jar</code> into <code>extra_out.jar</code>. Note that only the
order of the options matters; the additional whitespace is just for clarity.
<p>
This grouping, archiving, and flattening can be arbitrarily complex. ProGuard
always tries to package output archives in a sensible way, reconstructing the
input entries as much as required.

<a name="filtering">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Filtering the input and the output</h3>

If you want even greater control, you can add filters to the input and the
output, filtering out zips, ears, wars, jars, and/or ordinary files. For
example, if you want to disregard certain files from an input jar:
<pre>
-injars  in.jar(!images/**)
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration removes any files in the <code>images</code> directory and
its subdirectories.
<p>
Such filters can be convenient for avoiding warnings about duplicate files in
the output. For example, only keeping the manifest file from a first input jar:
<pre>
-injars  in1.jar
-injars  in2.jar(!META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
-injars  in3.jar(!META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
Another useful application is speeding up the processing by ProGuard, by
disregarding a large number of irrelevant classes in the runtime library jar:
<pre>
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar(java/**,javax/**)
</pre>
<p>
The filter makes ProGuard disregard <code>com.sun.**</code> classes, for
instance , which don't affect the processing of ordinary applications.
<p>
It is also possible to filter the jars (and/or wars, ears, zips) themselves,
based on their names. For example:
<pre>
-injars  in(**/acme_*.jar;)
-outjars out.jar
</pre>
<p>
Note the semi-colon in the filter; the filter in front of it applies to jar
names. In this case, only <code>acme_*.jar</code> jars are read from the
directory <code>in</code> and its subdirectories. Filters for war names, ear
names, and zip names can be prefixed with additional semi-colons. All types of
filters can be combined. They are orthogonal.
<p>
On the other hand, you can also filter the output, in order to control what
content goes where. For example:
<pre>
-injars  in.jar
-outjars code_out.jar(**.class)
-outjars resources_out.jar
</pre>
<p>
This configuration splits the processed output, sending <code>**.class</code>
files to <code>code_out.jar</code>, and all remaining files to
<code>resources_out.jar</code>.
<p>
Again, the filtering can be arbitrarily complex, especially when combined with
the grouping of input and output.

<h3>Processing multiple applications at once</h3>
You can process several dependent or independent applications (or applets,
midlets,...) in one go, in order to save time and effort. ProGuard's input and
output handling offers various ways to keep the output nicely structured.
<p>
The easiest way is to specify your input jars (and/or wars, ears, zips, and
directories) and a single output directory. ProGuard will then reconstruct the
input in this directory, using the original jar names. For example, showing
just the input and output options:
<pre>
-injars  application1.jar
-injars  application2.jar
-injars  application3.jar
-outjars processed_applications
</pre>
<p>
After processing, the directory <code>processed_applications</code> will
contain the processed application jars, with their original names.

<a name="incremental">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Incremental obfuscation</h3>
After having <a href="#application">processed an application</a>, e.g.
ProGuard itself, you can still incrementally add other pieces of code that
depend on it, e.g. the ProGuard GUI:
<pre>
-injars       proguardgui.jar
-outjars      proguardgui_out.jar
-injars       proguard.jar
-outjars      proguard_out.jar
-libraryjars  &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-applymapping proguard.map

-keep public class proguard.gui.ProGuardGUI {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>
<p>
We're reading both unprocessed jars as input. Their processed contents will go
to the respective output jars. The <a
href="usage.html#applymapping"><code>-applymapping</code></a> option then
makes sure the ProGuard part of the code gets the previously produced
obfuscation mapping. The final application will consist of the obfuscated
ProGuard jar and the additional obfuscated GUI jar.
<p>
The added code in this example is straightforward; it doesn't affect the
original code. The <code>proguard_out.jar</code> will be identical to the one
produced in the initial processing step. If you foresee adding more complex
extensions to your code, you should specify the options <a
href="usage.html#useuniqueclassmembernames"><code>-useuniqueclassmembernames</code></a>,
<a href="usage.html#dontshrink"><code>-dontshrink</code></a>, and <a
href="usage.html#dontoptimize"><code>-dontoptimize</code></a> <i>in the
original processing step</i>. These options ensure that the obfuscated base
jar will always remain usable without changes. You can then specify the base
jar as a library jar:
<pre>
-injars       proguardgui.jar
-outjars      proguardgui_out.jar
-libraryjars  proguard.jar
-libraryjars  &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-applymapping proguard.map

-keep public class proguard.gui.ProGuardGUI {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>

<a name="deadcode">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Finding dead code</h3>
These options list unused classes, fields, and methods in the application
<code>mypackage.MyApplication</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-dontoptimize
-dontobfuscate
-printusage

-keep public class mypackage.MyApplication {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>
<p>
We're not specifying an output jar, just printing out some results. We're
saving some processing time by skipping the optimization and obfuscation
steps.
<p>
The java compiler inlines primitive constants (primitive <code>static
final</code> fields). ProGuard would therefore list such fields as not being
used in the class files that it analyzes, even if they <i>are</i> used in the
source files. We can add a <a
href="usage.html#keepclassmembers"><code>-keepclassmembers</code></a> option
that keeps those fields a priori, in order to avoid listing them:
<pre>
-keepclassmembers class * {
    static final % *;
}
</pre>

<a name="structure">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Printing out the internal structure of class files</h3>
These options print out the internal structure of all class files in the input
jar:
<pre>
-injars in.jar
-dontshrink
-dontoptimize
-dontobfuscate
-dump
</pre>
<p>
Note how we don't need to specify the Java run-time jar, because we're not
processing the input jar at all.
