<h2>Limitations</h2>

When using ProGuard, you should be aware of a few issues, all of which are
easily avoided or resolved:
<p>
<ul>
<li>ProGuard handles the essential elements of Java: classes, interfaces, class
    members, inheritance,... ProGuard itself is not aware of any additional
    <b>naming conventions or APIs</b>: main methods, native methods, beans,
    serialization,... You'll have to specify these in your configuration. The
    configuration syntax is intended to be compact, readable, expressive, and
    generally applicable. It's usually quite simple. The examples section of
    this manual provides many typical examples. The graphical user interface
    has checkboxes for common boilerplate configurations.
    <p>

<li>ProGuard currently copies <b>manifest files and resource files</b>
    unchanged. Directory entries, on the other hand, are not copied to the
    output jars. If your code has any special dependencies on these elements,
    you should modify or add them manually.
    <p>

<li>For efficiency, ProGuard always ignores any <b>private or package visible
    library classes</b> while reading library jars. If any of them are
    extended by public library classes, and then extended again by input
    classes, ProGuard will complain it can't find them. In that case, you'll
    have to use the <code>-dontskipnonpubliclibraryclasses</code> option, and
    maybe even the <code>-dontskipnonpubliclibraryclassmembers</code> option.
    The graphical user interface has checkboxes for these settings.
    <p>

<li>For best results, ProGuard's optimization algorithms assume that the
    processed code never <b>intentionally throws NullPointerExceptions</b> or
    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions, or even OutOfMemoryErrors or
    StackOverflowErrors, in order to achieve something useful. For instance,
    it may remove a method call <code>myObject.myMethod()</code> if that call
    wouldn't have any effect. It ignores that <code>myObject</code> might be
    null, causing a NullPointerException. In some way this is a good thing:
    optimized code may throw fewer exceptions. Should this entire assumption
    be false, you'll have to switch off optimization using the
    <code>-dontoptimize</code> option.
    <p>

<li>ProGuard's optimization algorithms also remove all <b>empty busy-waiting
    loops</b>, unless they test on fields that are marked as
    <code>volatile</code>. You should always mark tested fields as
    <code>volatile</code>, or otherwise, you'll have to switch off
    optimization using the <code>-dontoptimize</code> option.
    <p>

<li>If an input jar and a library jar contain classes in the <b>same
    package</b>, the obfuscated output jar may contain class names that
    overlap with class names in the library jar. This is most likely if the
    library jar has been obfuscated before, as it will then probably contain
    classes named 'a', 'b', etc. Packages should therefore never be split
    across input jars and library jars.
    <p>

<li>ProGuard may not handle <b>obfuscation marker interfaces</b> as expected.
    If you specify "<code>-keep class * implements MyKeepInterface</code>",
    and <code>MyKeepInterface</code> is not used in your code, the specified
    classes are kept, but they are obfuscated. Technically, the interface is
    removed in the shrinking phase, making the directive void in the
    obfuscation phase. This behavior may be fixed in the future. For now, you
    can get around it by explicitly keeping the interface as well:
    "<code>-keep class MyKeepInterface</code>". In any case, creating a proper
    configuration file seems a cleaner solution than using such an obfuscation
    marker interface.
    <p>

<li>When obfuscating, ProGuard will write out class files named
    "<code>a.class</code>", "<code>b.class</code>", etc. If there is a large
    numbers of classes in the same package, it may also write out
    <b>"<code>aux.class</code>"</b>. Windows doesn't allow creating files with
    this reserved name (among a few other names), so it's generally better to
    write the output to a jar, in order to avoid such problems.
    <p>

<li>ProGuard's obfuscation process currently doesn't follow the <b>naming
    rule</b> specifying that nested classes must be named as
    <code>EnclosingClass$InnerClass</code>, for instance (cfr. <a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/j.title.doc.html"
    >The Java Language Specification, Second Edition</a>, <a href=
    "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/binaryComp.doc.html#59892"
    >Section 13.1</a>). This should not present a problem in practice, since
    the rule is mainly intended for transformations at the source code level.
    Internal-external class relationships are still represented correctly
    inside the binary class files. Decompilers or others tools that rely on
    the naming rule may have problems processing obfuscated jars. I'm not
    aware of any such cases.
