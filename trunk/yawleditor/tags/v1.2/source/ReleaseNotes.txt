The Executables
---------------------

Version 1.2 of the YAWL editor caters to both the control flow perspective and 
the data perspective of YAWL.  YAWL Workflows can now be specified with the 
editor that manipulate state throught the lifecycle of a runnign workflow. 

This version of the YAWL editor is designed to be used only with YAWL Engine 
Beta 4.
 
Below is a brief discussion of the files available:

* YAWLEditor1.2.jar: 

The default editor distribution, allowing you to validate your specifications 
and export those specifications to the YAWL Engine.

* YAWLEditorLite1.2.jar:

Most of the editor's size (of 7ish Mb) come from libraries needed by the engine 
for creating and validating engine specifications.  If you don't need to export 
to the engine or to validate your specifications, this much smaller sized 
(about 630 Kb) editor may be more attractive.

Requirements:

    * Java J2SDK 1.4.2 or above. 

Installation and Running Instructions:

   1. Save the executable jar file to your computer.
   2. Either double-click on the editor jar from a file explorer window, or 
      from a command-line prompt, type: 

# java -jar YAWLEditor[Lite]1.2.jar
