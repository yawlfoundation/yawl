Version 1.2 (22/05/2005) "HermeticMemeticDisorder"
  * Stopped the editor from quoting double (") and single quote (') characters in
    XQuery exports to the engine. Double quote characters cause problems in the 
    engine when they're not quoted (exceptions raised), and when they ARE quoted 
    (produce &amp;quot; instead of &quot;).  
  * Related to the above, XPath and XQuery expression editors will not allow users
    to type in (") characters. Text literals in these expressions should use the (')
    character only.
  * Fixed a bug where pressing the XQuery button on a parameter update dialog
    would not enable the Done button, even though all the data needed for 
    allowing the button tobe enabled was supplied.
  * Built in integrated support for a utility called wofyawl, which allows 
    users to analyse their specifications for things like invalid flows and
    cancellation set members. The tool can be configured from the "Tools"
    menu item (see below).
  * The old "Tools" menu has been renamed "Elements".
  * The "Engine" menu has been renamed "Tools", and this will be the new home 
    for setting up interfacing into all external tools the editor relies on.
  * Fixed a bug where the specification ID of an exported specification 
    contained spaces if the filename of the editor file had spaces. Spaces
    in the specification Id causes engine problems.
  * Decomposition dialogs now resize dynamically to match decomposition 
    variables.
  * The Update Parameter dialog now shows net and task variables as a
    user convenience.
  * Fixed a bug where cutting elements out of a net would result in 
    illegal orphaned flows.
  * Fixed a bug where exceptions were being thrown on cut actions.
  * Made a change to Palette buttons and some toolbar menu items 
    so when they're disabled, they offer advice on what's needed to enable them.
  * Moving selected elements in a net is now with arrow key-presses (instead of
    <ALT-arrow key>) to make it match user intuition more closely.
  * The "Save Specification As" menu item no longer has a hotkey of CTRL-A. CTRL-A
    instead, selects all elements of the current net with input focus.

Version 1.1-1 (28/02/2005) "Paraselsus"
  * Validation is now displayed in a split pane buried in the editor proper, 
    instead of being a floating dialog.
  * Fixed a bug where copying/cutting and then pasting elements in a currently
    viewed cancelleation set would have the pasted elements rendered as if 
    they were still in the cancellation set.
  * Fixed a bug where clicking the ``Done'' button when focus was in a 
    Decomposition label field would have the first button press ignored. 
    Similarly for variable name fields and their "Done" buttons.
  * Changing decomposition labels will now automatically propogate the change
    to parameter XQueries and split predicates that use the changed decomposition.
  * Changing variable names will now automatically propogate the change to 
    parameter XQueries and split predicates that used the changed variable name.
  * Net additions and deletions are now undoable edits. 
  * Made the editor validation code ignore unregistered service errors returned 
    from engine validation. 
  * Fixed a thread synchronisation bug where a user could force a double-save
    of a specification. This had several nasty side effects, including 
    corrupting save files, the dropping of a nasty exception, and the hanging 
    of the editor on trying to load a corrupted save file.
  * The parameter update dialog now disables the "Done" button whenever the 
    XQuery editor contains no text or there is no output variable for the query.
  * Resizing a net no longer causes a repositioning of the viewport into the nets.  
    It's an irritant for users drawing large nets.
  * Added an Anti-Alias toggle menu item to the view menu. Large nets render 
    slowly with anti-aliasing on.
  * Added a "Show grids in diagrams" menu item under the View menu. Again, 
    this was needed as a speed enhancement for people drawing large nets.
  * Refactored Ant build script to minimise the work required to produce new 
    releases of the editor.
  * Changed color of the progress bars to make them stand out more.

Version 1.1 (04/02/2005): "Trimagistrum"
  * Fixed a bug where deleting a task who's cancellation 
    set is being viewed fails to change the color of its 
    cancellation set members back to normal.
  * The data perspective is now supported by the editor. Specifically:
    * XMLSchema can be used to describe complex types of variables.
    * Variables can be set for nets and tasks. 
    * XQuery parameter expressions trasform state betwen net and task variables.
    * OR/XOR Splits now use XPath boolean predicates to select which flows to use.
    * Multiple-Instance tasks use XQuery expression for task splitting/aggregation.
  * You can now print entire specifications.
  * The editor can connect to running engines, and allow users to build 
    specifications using the actual services registered with that engine.
  * Users can change the label size on net elements.

Version 1.0 (18/05/2004): "Hermes"
  * Base Release
