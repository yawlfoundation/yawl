  ProGuard is a free class file shrinker, optimizer, and obfuscator.\
  \n\n\
  With this GUI, you can create, load, modify, and save ProGuard configurations. \
  \n\
  You can then process your code right away, or you can run ProGuard from the \
  command line using your saved configuration. \
  \n\n\
  With the ReTrace part of this GUI you can de-obfuscate your stack traces.\
  \n\n\
  ProGuard and ReTrace are written and maintained by Eric Lafortune.\
  \n\n\
  Based on class file IO code by Mark Welsh.\

processingInfo = \
  You can now start processing your code, \
  or you can run ProGuard from the command line using your saved configuration.\
  \n\n\
  It's always a good idea to save your configuration first.

reTraceInfo = \
  If you had ProGuard write out a mapping file, \
  you can de-obfuscate your obfuscated stack traces with ReTrace!\
  \n\n\
  You can load an obfuscated stack trace from a file, \
  or you can paste it straight into the text area above.
