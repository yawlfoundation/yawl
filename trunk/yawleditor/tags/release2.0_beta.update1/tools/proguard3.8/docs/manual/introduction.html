<h2>Introduction</h2>

<b>ProGuard</b> is a Java class file shrinker, optimizer, and obfuscator. The
shrinking step detects and removes unused classes, fields, methods, and
attributes. The optimization step analyzes and optimizes the bytecode of the
methods. The obfuscation step renames the remaining classes, fields, and
methods using short meaningless names. The resulting jars are smaller and
harder to reverse-engineer.
<p>
ProGuard can also be used to list unused classes, fields, and methods in an
application, and to print out the internal structure of class files.

ProGuard typically reads the <b>input jars</b> (or wars, ears, zips, or
directories). It then shrinks, optimizes, and obfuscates them. It then writes
the results to one or more <b>output jars</b> (or wars, ears, zips, or
directories). The input jars can optionally contain resource files. ProGuard
copies all non-class resource files from the input jars to the output jars.
Their names and contents remain unchanged.
<p>
ProGuard requires the <b>library jars</b> (or wars, ears, zips, or
directories) of the input jars to be specified. It can then reconstruct class
hierarchies and other class dependencies, which are necessary for proper
shrinking, optimization, and obfuscation. The library jars themselves always
remain unchanged. You should still put them in the class path of your final
application.
<p>
In order to determine which code has to be preserved and which code can be
discarded or obfuscated, you have to specify one or more entry points to your
code. These entry points are typically classes with main methods, applets,
midlets, etc.
<ul>
<li>In the <b>shrinking step</b>, ProGuard starts from these seeds and
    recursively determines which classes and class members are used. All other
    classes and class members are discarded.

<li>In the <b>optimization step</b>, ProGuard further optimizes the code.
    Among other optimizations, classes and methods that are not entry points
    can be made private, static, or final, unused parameters can be removed,
    and some methods may be inlined.

<li>In the <b>obfuscation step</b>, ProGuard renames classes and class members
    that are not entry points. In this entire process, keeping the entry
    points ensures that they can still be accessed by their original names.
</ul>
<p>
Any classes or class members of your code that are created or invoked
dynamically (that is, by name) have to be specified as entry points too. It is
generally impossible to determine these cases automatically, but ProGuard will
offer some suggestions if keeping some classes or class members appears
necessary. For proper results, you should at least be somewhat familiar with
the code that you are processing.
<p>
ProGuard does handle <code>Class.forName("SomeClass")</code> and
<code>SomeClass.class</code> constructs automatically. The referenced classes
are preserved in the shrinking phase, and the string arguments are properly
replaced in the obfuscation phase. With variable string arguments, it is
generally impossible to determine their possible values (they might be read
from a configuration file, for instance). However, as mentioned, ProGuard will
note constructs like
"<code>(SomeClass)Class.forName(variable).newInstance()</code>". These might
be an indication that the class or interface <code>SomeClass</code> and/or its
implementations may need to be preserved. You can then adapt your configuration
accordingly.
