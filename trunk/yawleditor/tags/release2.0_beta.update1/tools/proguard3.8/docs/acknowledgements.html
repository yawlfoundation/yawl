<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<b>ProGuard</b> grew out of <b>RetroGuard</b>, which its author Mark Welsh has
kindly made available under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
<b>RetroGuard</b> is a very nice piece of code, but it only performed
obfuscation. I started from the class file parsing code and wrote my own
shrinker, optimizer, and obfuscator. At this point, both programs have little
code in common.
<p>

Dirk Schnelle has contributed and maintained the first versions of the Ant
task. I have rewritten the implementation for version 3.0, but the XML schema
is still based on his work.
<p>

Since its first public release, many people have expressed their enthusiasm and
have chimed in with interesting ideas, bug reports, and bug fixes: Thorsten
Heit, Oliver Retzl, Jonathan Knudsen, Tarcisio Camara, Bob Drury, Dave Jarvis,
Marc Chapman, Dave Morehouse, Richard Osbaldeston, Peter Hawkins, Mark
Sherington, David Sitsky, James Manning, Ptolemy Oberin, Frank-Michael Moser,
QZ Shines, Thomas Singer, Michele Puccini, Roman Bednarek, Natalia Pujol,
Daniel Sj&ouml;blom, Jan Filipsky, Charles Smith, Gerrit Telkamp, Noel
Grandin, Torbj&ouml;rn S&ouml;derstedt, Clemens Eisserer, Clark Bassett,
and many others. Thanks! Your feedback has been invaluable.
<p>

I am developing ProGuard in my spare time, in part on equipment that my
employer <a href="http://www.luciad.com/" target="other">Luciad</a> is kindly
allowing me to use.
<p>

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/projects/proguard/"
target="other">SourceForge</a> is generously providing the resources for
hosting this project and many other projects.
<p>

JetBrains is kindly providing a license for its IntelliJ IDEA development
environment.
<p>

The code and these web pages were written using Sun's JDKs, Linux, IntelliJ
IDEA, GNU emacs, bash, sed, awk, and a whole host of other tools that continue
to make programming interesting.
