The Executables
-------------------------

Version @EditorReleaseNumber@ of the YAWL editor caters to both the control flow perspective 
and the data perspective of YAWL along with some very basic support for the 
resource perspective. YAWL Workflows can now be specified with the editor 
that manipulate state throught the lifecycle of a runnign workflow. 
This version of the YAWL editor is designed to be used only with YAWL Engine 
@CompatibleEngineReleaseNumber@. 
 
Below is a brief discussion of the files available:

* YAWLEditor@EditorReleaseNumber@.jar: 

The default editor distribution, allowing you to validate your specifications 
and export those specifications to the YAWL Engine.

* YAWLEditorLite@EditorReleaseNumber@.jar:

Note that each Megabyte of size beyound the first of the editor comes from libraries 
needed by the engine for creating and validating engine specifications.  If you don't 
need to export to the engine or to validate your specifications, this much smaller sized 
editor may be more attractive.

* wofyawl@WofYawlReleaseNumber@-win32.exe
* wofyawl@WofYawlReleaseNumber@-linux-x86.exe

Supplied with this release are a binary windows and Linux 
executable versions of wofyawl.exe.  When placed in the same 
directory as the editor, workflow designers will be able to analyse 
their workflows for deadlock, redundant cancellation set members, 
etc. Note that the editor expects the executable to be called 
"wofyawl@WofYawlReleaseNumber@.exe", regardless of the platform on which 
it runs. Choose the wofyawl implementation right for you, and then rename 
it to get analysis to work.

Requirements:

    * Java @CompatibleJavaReleaseNumber@ or above. 

Installation and Running Instructions:

   1. Save the executable jar file to your computer.
   2. Optionally save the wofyawl.exe program into the same directory.
   3. Either double-click on the editor jar from a file explorer window, or 
      from a command-line prompt, type: 

# java -jar YAWLEditor[Lite]@EditorReleaseNumber@.jar
