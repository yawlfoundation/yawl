<h2>Introduction</h2>

<b>ReTrace</b> is a companion tool for <b>ProGuard</b> that 'de-obfuscates'
stack traces. When an obfuscated program throws an exception, the resulting
stack trace typically isn't very informative. Class names and method names
have been replaced by short meaningless strings. Source file names and line
numbers are missing altogether. While this may be intentional, it can also be
inconvenient when debugging problems.

<p>
ReTrace can read an obfuscated stack trace and restore it to what it would
look like without obfuscation. The restoration is based on the mapping file
that ProGuard can write out during obfuscation. The mapping file links the
original class names and class member names to their obfuscated names.
