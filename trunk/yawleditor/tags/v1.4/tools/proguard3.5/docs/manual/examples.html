You can find some sample configuration files in the <code>examples</code>
directory of the ProGuard distribution.

<a name="application">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>A typical application</h3>
To shrink, optimize, and obfuscate the ProGuard application itself, one would
typically create a configuration file <code>proguard.pro</code> and then type:
<pre>
java -jar proguard.jar @proguard.pro
</pre>
<p>

The configuration file would contain the following options:
<pre>
-injars       proguard.jar
-outjars      proguard_out.jar
-libraryjars  &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-printmapping proguard.map
-overloadaggressively
-defaultpackage ''
-allowaccessmodification

-keep public class proguard.ProGuard {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of the <code>&lt;java.home&gt;</code> system property; it is
replaced automatically.
<p>
Also note that the type names are fully specified:
<code>proguard.ProGuard</code> and <code>java.lang.String[]</code>.
<p>
The access modifiers <code>public</code> and <code>static</code> are not
really required in this case, since we know a priori that the specified class
and method have the proper access flags. It just looks more familiar this way.
<p>
We're using the <code>-overloadaggressively</code>,
<code>-defaultpackage</code>, and <code>-allowaccessmodification</code>
options to shave off some extra bytes, but we could leave them out as well.
The <code>-defaultpackage</code> directive moves all classes to the given
package, in this case the root package. Only <code>proguard.ProGuard</code>
keeps its original name.
<p>
We're writing out an obfuscation mapping file with <code>-printmapping</code>,
for de-obfuscating any stack traces later on, or for incremental obfuscation of
extensions.
<p>
In general, you might need a few additional directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#serializable">serializable
classes</a>, <a href="#beans">bean classes</a>, or <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>. For processing 'simple' applications like
ProGuard, that is not required.

<a name="applet">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>A typical applet</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate the applet
<code>mypackage.MyApplet</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar

-keep public class mypackage.MyApplet
</pre>
<p>
The typical applet methods will be preserved automatically, since
<code>mypackage.MyApplet</code> is an extension of the <code>Applet</code>
class in the library <code>rt.jar</code>.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#serializable">serializable
classes</a>, <a href="#beans">bean classes</a>, or <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>.

<a name="midlet">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>A typical midlet</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate the J2ME midlet
<code>mypackage.MyMIDlet</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/wtk2.1/lib/midpapi20.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/wtk2.1/lib/cldcapi11.jar
-overloadaggressively
-defaultpackage ''
-allowaccessmodification

-keep public class mypackage.MyMIDlet
</pre>
<p>
Note how we're now targeting the J2ME run-time environment of
<code>midpapi20.jar</code> and <code>cldcapi11.jar</code>, instead of the J2SE
run-time environment <code>rt.jar</code>. You can target other J2ME
environments by picking the appropriate jars.
<p>
The typical midlet methods will be preserved automatically, since
<code>mypackage.MyMIDlet</code> is an extension of the <code>MIDlet</code>
class in the library <code>midpapi20.jar</code>.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#serializable">serializable
classes</a>, <a href="#beans">bean classes</a>, or <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>.
<p>
You must preverify your midlets <i>after</i> having processed them, using
J2ME's <code>preverify</code> tool. Because this tool unpacks your processed
jars, you should use ProGuard's <code>-dontusemixedcaseclassnames</code>
option on platforms with case-insensitive filing systems, such as Windows.
<p>
Please note the in-depth article <a
href="http://developers.sun.com/techtopics/mobility/midp/ttips/proguard/">"Obfuscating
MIDlet Suites with ProGuard"</a> at <a
href="http://developers.sun.com/">developers.sun.com</a>.

<a name="applications">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>All possible applications in the input jars</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate all public applications in
<code>in.jar</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-printseeds

-keepclasseswithmembers public class * {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of <code>-keepclasseswithmembers</code>. We don't want to preserve
all classes, just all classes that have main methods, and those methods.
<p>
The <code>-printseeds</code> option prints out which classes exactly will
be preserved, so we know for sure we're getting what we want.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#serializable">serializable
classes</a>, <a href="#beans">bean classes</a>, or <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>.

<a name="applets">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>All possible applets in the input jars</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate all public applets in
<code>in.jar</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-printseeds

-keep public class * extends java.applet.Applet
</pre>
<p>
We're simply keeping all classes that extend the <code>Applet</code> class.
<p>
Again, the <code>-printseeds</code> option prints out which applets exactly
will be preserved.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#serializable">serializable
classes</a>, <a href="#beans">bean classes</a>, or <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>.

<a name="midlets">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>All possible midlets in the input jars</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate all public J2ME midlets in
<code>in.jar</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/wtk2.1/lib/midpapi20.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/wtk2.1/lib/cldcapi11.jar
-overloadaggressively
-defaultpackage ''
-allowaccessmodification
-printseeds

-keep public class * extends javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet
</pre>
<p>
We're simply keeping all classes that extend the <code>MIDlet</code> class.
<p>
And again, the <code>-printseeds</code> option prints out which midlets exactly
will be preserved.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#serializable">serializable
classes</a>, <a href="#beans">bean classes</a>, or <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>.
<p>
You must preverify your midlets <i>after</i> having processed them, using
J2ME's <code>preverify</code> tool. Because this tool unpacks your processed
jars, you should use ProGuard's <code>-dontusemixedcaseclassnames</code>
option on platforms with case-insensitive filing systems, such as Windows.

<a name="servlets">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>All possible servlets in the input jars</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate all public servlets in
<code>in.jar</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-outjars     out.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-libraryjars /usr/local/java/servlet/servlet.jar
-printseeds

-keep public class * implements javax.servlet.Servlet
</pre>
<p>
Keeping all servlets is very similar to keeping all applets. The servlet API
is not part of the standard run-time jar, so we're specifying it as a library.
Don't forget to use the right path name.
<p>
We're then keeping all classes that implement the <code>Servlet</code>
interface. We're using the <code>implements</code> keyword because it looks
more familiar in this context, but it is equivalent to <code>extends</code>,
as far as ProGuard is concerned.
<p>
And again, the <code>-printseeds</code> option prints out which servlets
exactly will be preserved.
<p>
If applicable, you should add directives for processing <a
href="#native">native methods</a>, <a href="#serializable">serializable
classes</a>, <a href="#beans">bean classes</a>, or <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a>.

<a name="library">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing a library</h3>
These options shrink, optimize, and obfuscate an entire library, keeping all
public and protected classes and class members, native method names, and
serialization code:
<pre>
-injars       in.jar
-outjars      out.jar
-libraryjars  &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-printmapping out.map

-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile
-keepattributes InnerClasses,SourceFile,LineNumberTable,Deprecated,
                Signature,*Annotation*,EnclosingMethod

-keep public class * {
    public protected *;
}

-keepclassmembernames class * {
    java.lang.Class class$(java.lang.String);
    java.lang.Class class$(java.lang.String, boolean);
}

-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {
    native &lt;methods&gt;;
}

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}

-keepclassmembers class * extends java.lang.Enum {
    public **[] values();
}
</pre>
<p>
This configuration should preserve everything we'll ever want to access in the
library. Only if there are any other non-public classes or methods that are
invoked dynamically, they should be specified using additional
<code>-keep</code> directives.
<p>
The <code>-keepclassmembernames</code> directive for the <code>class$</code>
methods is not strictly necessary. These methods are inserted by the
<code>javac</code> compiler and the <code>jikes</code> compiler respectively,
to implement the <code>.class</code> construct. ProGuard will automatically
detect them and deal with them, even when their names have been obfuscated.
However, older versions of ProGuard and other obfuscators may rely on the
original method names. It may therefore be helpful to preserve them, in case
these other obfuscators are ever used for further obfuscation of the library.
<p>
We've added some directives for keeping the "Deprecated" attribute, for <a
href="#stacktrace">useful stack traces</a>, for <a href="#native">native
methods</a>, <a href="#serializable">serializable classes</a>, and for <a
href="#annotations">annotations</a> (possibly with enumerations), which are
all discussed in their respective examples.
<p>
The "InnerClasses" attribute (or more precisely, its source name part) has to
be preserved as well, for any inner classes that can be referenced from
outside the library. The <code>javac</code> compiler would be unable to find
the inner classes otherwise.
<p>
The "Signature" attribute is required to be able to access generic types when
compiling in JDK 5.0.

<a name="native">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing native methods</h3>
If your application, applet, servlet, library, etc., contains native methods,
you'll want to preserve their names and their classes' names, so they can
still be linked to the native library. The following additional option will
ensure that:
<pre>
-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {
    native &lt;methods&gt;;
}
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of <code>-keepclasseswithmembernames</code>. We don't want to
preserve all classes or all native methods; we just want to keep the relevant
names from being obfuscated.
<p>
ProGuard doesn't have your native code, so it can't automatically preserve the
classes or class members that are invoked by the native code. These are entry
points, which you'll have to specify explicitly.

<a name="serializable">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing serializable classes</h3>
More complex applications, applets, servlets, libraries, etc., may contain
classes that are serialized. Depending on the way in which they are used, they
may require special attention:
<ul>

<li>Often, serialization is simply a means of transporting data, without
    long-term storage. Classes that are shrunk and obfuscated should then
    continue to function fine with the following additional directives:

<pre>
-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>

    The <code>-keepclassmembers</code> option makes sure that any
    serialization methods are kept. By using this directive instead of the
    basic <code>-keep</code> directive, we're not forcing preservation of
    <i>all</i> serializable classes, just preservation of the listed members
    of classes that are actually used.
    <p>

<li>Sometimes, the serialized data are stored, and read back later into newer
    versions of the serializable classes. One then has to take care the classes
    remain compatible with their unprocessed versions and with future
    processed versions. In such cases, the relevant classes will most likely
    have <code>serialVersionUID</code> fields. The following directives should
    then be sufficient to ensure compatibility over time:

<pre>
-keepnames class * implements java.io.Serializable

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    !static !transient &lt;fields&gt;;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>

    The <code>serialVersionUID</code> line makes sure that field is preserved.
    The <code>&lt;fields&gt;</code> line preserves all non-static,
    non-transient fields, with their original names. The introspection of the
    serialization process and the de-serialization process will then find
    consistent names.

<li>Occasionally, the serialized data have to remain compatible, but the
    classes involved lack <code>serialVersionUID</code> fields. I imagine the
    original code will then be hard to maintain, since the serial version UID
    is then computed from a list of features the serializable class. Changing
    the class ever so slightly may change the computed serial version UID. The
    list of features is specified in the chapter on <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/serialization/spec/class.html#wp4100">Stream
    Unique Identifiers</a> of Sun's <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/serialization/">Object
    Serialization Guide</a>. The following directives should at least
    partially ensure compatibility with the original classes

<pre>
-keepnames class * implements java.io.Serializable

-keepclassmembers class * implements java.io.Serializable {
    static final long serialVersionUID;
    !static !transient &lt;fields&gt;;
    !private &lt;fields&gt;;
    !private &lt;methods&gt;;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream);
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream);
    java.lang.Object writeReplace();
    java.lang.Object readResolve();
}
</pre>
<p>

    The new directives force preservation of the elements involved in the UID
    computation. In addition, the user will have to manually specify all
    interfaces of the serializable classes (using something like "<code>-keep
    interface MyInterface</code>"), since these names are also used when
    computing the UID. A fast but sub-optimal alternative would be simply
    keeping all interfaces with "<code>-keep interface *</code>".

</ul>
<p>

Note that the above directives may preserve more classes and class members
than strictly necessary. For instance, a large number of classes may implement
the <code>Serialization</code> interface, yet only a small number may actually
ever be serialized. Knowing your application and tuning the configuration will
often produce more compact results.

<a name="beans">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing bean classes</h3>
If your application, applet, servlet, library, etc., uses extensive
introspection on bean classes to find bean editor classes, or getter and
setter methods, then configuration may become laborious. There's not much else
you can do than making sure the bean class names, or the getter and setter
names don't change. For instance:
<pre>
-keep public class mypackage.MyBean {
    public void setMyProperty(int);
    public int getMyProperty();
}

-keep public class mypackage.MyBeanEditor
</pre>
<p>
If there are too many elements to list explicitly, wildcards in class names
and method signatures might be helpful. This example encompasses a wide range
of setters and getters:
<pre>
-keep class mybeans.** {
    void set*(%);
    void set*(**);
    void set*(%[]);
    void set*(**[]);
    void set*(int, %);
    void set*(int, **);

    %    get*();
    **   get*();
    %[]  get*();
    **[] get*();
    %    get*(int);
    **   get*(int);
}
</pre>
<p>
The '<code>%</code>' wildcard matches any primitive type, while the
'<code>**</code>' wildcard matches any class name. Array types  have to be
specified explicitly. This results in a short list of alternative method
signatures.

<a name="annotations">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing annotations</h3>
As of JDK 5.0, class files can contain annotations. Annotations are
represented by attributes that have no direct effect on the execution of the
code. However, their values can be retrieved through introspection, allowing
developers to adapt the execution behavior accordingly. By default, ProGuard
treats annotation attributes as optional, and removes them in the obfuscation
step. If they are required, you'll have to specify this explicitly:
<pre>
-keepattributes *Annotation*

-keepclassmembers class * extends java.lang.Enum {
    public static **[] values();
}
</pre>
<p>
For brevity, we're specifying a wildcarded attribute name, which will match
<code>RuntimeVisibleAnnotations</code>,
<code>RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations</code>,
<code>RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations</code>,
<code>RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations</code>, and
<code>AnnotationDefault</code>. Depending on the purpose of the processed
code, you could refine this selection, for instance not keeping the run-time
invisible annotations (which are only used at compile-time).
<p>
If your annotations contain enumeration classes, you'll have to preserve the
<code>values()</code> method in these classes. The run-time environment
accesses this method by introspection (Isn't that just grand? Introspection is
the self-modifying code of a new generation).
<p>
Some code may make further use of introspection to figure out the enclosing
methods of anonymous inner classes. In that case, the corresponding attribute
will have to be preserved as well:
<pre>
-keepattributes EnclosingMethod
</pre>

<a name="componentui">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing ComponentUI classes</h3>
Swing UI look and feels are implemented as extensions of the
<code>ComponentUI</code> class. For some reason, these have to contain a
static method <code>createUI</code>, which the Swing API invokes using
introspection. You should therefore always preserve the method as an entry
point, for instance like this:
<pre>
-keep class * extends javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI {
    public static javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI createUI(javax.swing.JComponent);
}
</pre>
<p>
This directive also keeps the classes themselves.

<a name="rmi">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing RMI code</h3>
Reportedly, the easiest way to handle RMI code is to process the code with
ProGuard first and then invoke the <code>rmic</code> tool. If that is not
possible, you may want to try something like this:
<pre>
-keep interface * extends java.rmi.Remote {
    &lt;methods&gt;;
}

-keep class * implements java.rmi.Remote {
    &lt;init&gt;(java.rmi.activation.ActivationID, java.rmi.MarshalledObject);
}
</pre>
<p>
The first directive keeps all your Remote interfaces and their methods. The
second one keeps all the implementations, along with their particular RMI
constructors, if any.

<a name="stacktrace">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Producing useful obfuscated stack traces</h3>
These options let obfuscated applications or libraries produce stack traces
that can still be deciphered later on:
<pre>
-printmapping out.map

-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable
</pre>
<p>
We're keeping all source file attributes, but we're replacing their values by
the string "SourceFile". We could use any string. This string is already
present in all class files, so it doesn't take up any extra space. If you're
working with J++, you'll want to keep the "SourceDir" attribute as well.
<p>
We're also keeping the line number tables of all methods.
<p>
Whenever both of these attributes are present, the Java run-time environment
will include line number information when printing out exception stack traces.
<p>
The information will only be useful if we can map the obfuscated names back to
their original names, so we're saving the mapping to a file
<code>out.map</code>. The information can then be used by the <a
href="retrace/index.html">ReTrace</a> tool to restore the original stack trace.

<a name="multiple">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Processing multiple applications at once</h3>
You can process several independent applications (or applets, midlets,...) in
one go, in order to save time and effort. ProGuard's input and output handling
offers various ways to keep the output nicely structured.
<p>
The easiest way is to specify your input jars (and/or wars, ears, zips, and
directories) and a single output directory. ProGuard will then reconstruct the
input in this directory, using the original jar names. For example, showing
just the input and output options:
<pre>
-injars  application1.jar
-injars  application2.jar
-injars  application3.jar
-injars  application.war
-outjars processed_applications
</pre>
<p>
After processing, the directory <code>processed_applications</code> will
contain the processed application jars and war, with their original names.
<p>
If you want explicit control over the output names, or if you want to combine
input jars (and/or wars, ears, zips, or directories) into output jars (and/or
wars, ears, zips, or directories), you can group the <code>-injars</code> and
<code>-outjars</code> options. For example:
<pre>
-injars  application1.jar
-injars  application2.jar
-injars  application3.jar
-outjars application_out1.war

-injars  application.war
-outjars application_out2.war
</pre>
<p>
This configuration creates two wars: one containing all processed application
jars, and one containing the processed contents of the input war.
<p>
Note that ProGuard will try to package output archives in a sensible way,
reconstructing the input entries as much as required. If you want even greater
control, you can add filters to the input and the output, filtering out zips,
ears, wars, jars, and/or ordinary files.

<a name="incremental">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Incremental obfuscation</h3>
After having <a href="#application">processed an application</a>, e.g.
ProGuard itself, you can still incrementally add other pieces of code that
depend on it, e.g. the ProGuard GUI:
<pre>
-injars       proguardgui.jar
-outjars      proguardgui_out.jar
-libraryjars  &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-libraryjars  proguard.jar
-applymapping proguard.map

-keep public class proguard.gui.ProGuardGUI {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>
<p>
We're reading both unprocessed jars: the new one as the input jar, and the old
one as a library jar. The <code>-applymapping</code> option then makes sure
the ProGuard part of the code gets the previously produced obfuscation
mapping. The final application will consist of the obfuscated ProGuard jar and
the additional obfuscated GUI jar.

<a name="deadcode">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Finding dead code</h3>
These options list unused fields and methods in the application
<code>mypackage.MyApplication</code>:
<pre>
-injars      in.jar
-libraryjars &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/rt.jar
-dontoptimize
-dontobfuscate
-printusage

-keep public class mypackage.MyApplication {
    public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
</pre>
<p>
We're not specifying an output jar, just printing out some results.
<p>
We're saving a little bit of time by skipping the optimization and obfuscation
steps.

<a name="structure">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>Printing out the internal structure of class files</h3>
These options print out the internal structure of all class files in the input
jar:
<pre>
-injars in.jar
-dontshrink
-dontoptimize
-dontobfuscate
-dump
</pre>
<p>
Note how we don't need to specify the Java run-time jar, because we're not
processing the input jar at all.
