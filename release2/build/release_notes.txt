                      YAWL Release 2.0 beta (Update 1) 04/07/2008
                      ===========================================

This beta update is an interim release of the YAWL Environment, which fixes several
problems and introduces some new features as we move towards a version 2.0 production
release.

Please read the change list below and the previous 2.0 beta release notes further down
the page.


!!   IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a existing installation of YAWL Release 2.0 beta,  !!
!!   please be aware that there has been a number of changes to column names and    !!
!!   data types in the persisted data tables to better support a wider variety of   !!
!!   database backends. As a consequence, it is necessary to remove or modify the   !!
!!   tables in the previously created database BEFORE this update 1 version is      !!
!!   started in Tomcat - persistence will fail if this is not done. If the current  !!
!!   tables do not contain important information, they can all be removed (dropped) !!
!!   from the yawl database using a Postgres admin tool - they will be recreated    !!
!!   when Tomcat restarts. If you wish to retain the information currently in the   !!
!!   tables, you must apply the sql script 'YAWL_update_tables.sql' to the tables   !!
!!   using a Postgres admin tool. If you have installed the worklet service, the    !!
!!   script 'Worklet_update_tables.sql' must also be run. Similarly for other       !!
!!   database backends; edit the scripts as required (to mask keywords). The        !!
!!   scripts can be downloaded from the YAWL download page on sourceForge.          !!


QUICK START: After installation, start Tomcat and point a browser to
             http://localhost:8080/resourceService


1. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
  * Tomcat 5.5.25 or higher
  * Java 5 (1.5) or higher


2. CHANGES IN THIS UPDATE
-------------------------
(a) EDITOR:
  - Resource Wizard dialogs now remain 'always on top' when active.
  - In the Resource Dialogs, replaced all occurrences of 'Users' with 'Participants'Êand
    reworded/corrected the text where necessary.
  - In the Resource Dialogs, sorted the participant and role lists. Deferred allocation
    list now shows net-level vars (restricted to String type only).
  - In the Resource Wizard, fixed the "retain familiar" and "4-eye principle"
    checkboxes so they could be deselected after being selected (i.e. can now undo
    a previous choice).
  - Added the ability to mark/unmark a decomposition as 'automated' in the decomposition
    dialog.
  - Set 'Manage Resourcing' menu to only be available when the decomposition is not
    'automated'.
  - Added the ability to set a 'codelet' for an automated task, which will be executed
    when the task is enabled.
  - Modified parameter mapping dialog so that a choice can be made between mapping a
    task variable's value or an expression to an output parameter.
  - Completed functionality of task timer setting, so that a timer can be set by
    fixed expiry date, duraton or deferred values via a net-level parameter. To
    facilitate the deferred option, a new type, YTimerType, has been included as a
    basic data type.
  - Refactored the 'save on exit' dialog functionality so that it only appears if
    changes have been made since the last save.
  - Removed the "Verify Password" field from "Set Resourcing Service" and "Set Engine
    Detail".
  - Various renaming of menu items throughout.
  - Modified the schema preamble in the data definition dialog by prefixing 'xs:',
    allowing for symbolic referencing in data schemas.
  - Also in the data definition dialog, added Copy, Cut, Paste, Undo and Redo buttons
    and CTRL-V and CTRL-C as shortcuts; also changed the length of a TAB to 2 spaces
    (down from 16); and doubled the initial size of the dialog.
  - Checkbox added to export specification dialog to auto increment version number.
    The version number is now saved when dialog exits, and is reflected in spec xml.
  - The export specification dialog will now ask for a valid specification id the first
    time a specification is exported, if it hasn't already been set in the specification
    properties; 'unnamed.ywl' is no longer considered to be a valid id.
  - Fixed a bug that was throwing an exception if a role name uses the "&" symbol.
  - Fixed generation of export files containing simply the word 'null' if a problem
    occurred during xml generation. Now a warning dialog will display and the file will
    not be created.
  - Added a 'Drop Task Decomposition' menu item to the task popup menu, which
    disconnects a task from a decomposition (but does not remove it from the editor
    session, so that it can be rejoined to the task or used by other tasks).
  - Refactored code so that new connection attempts to the engine or resource service
    with different details reinitiates the connection (previously they were ignored).
    Also improved the dialog's look and feel.
  - When creating a new specification, its window size will completely fit within the
    outer window.
  - When importing a specification from xml, its window size will completely fit within
    the outer window.
  - A warning dialog displays when a connection with the resource service is not
    available, and the "Manage Resourcing" menu is selected.
  - Fixed a bug where, if the name of a complex type is too long, other widgets were
    "cramped" in the update parameters dialog.
  - Added the ability to specify a 'custom form' for a task.
  - Fixed a bug where open net references were being displayed in the wrong place on
    the View menu.
  - Fixed bug where importing a specification from xml would its lose flow parameters.
  - Fixed bug where importing a specification from xml with more than a single net
    would start non-root nets iconified.


(b) ENGINE / RESOURCE SERVICE:
  - Renamed a number of database table columns to avoid reserved word and naming
    conflicts with various database systems. The YAWL environment has been tested to
    successfully run with postgres, mysql, hsqldb, oracle & derby.
  - Enhanced specification versioning, so that different versions of the same
    specification can co-exist in the engine.
  - Removed the superfluous <externalInteraction> tags from net-level decompositions;
    external interactions are only relevant for task decompositions.
  - Added encryption to password storage for participants.
  - Added some persistence fixes (courtesy of Matt Flaherty).
  - Corrected a couple of issues with the encoding/decoding of reserved characters in
    xml values being passed across the various interfaces.
  - Fixed an ordering bug in the specification schema which was inserting custom service
    references in the wrong place.
  - Added a unique identifier to all newly generated specifications.
  - Refactored/improved the interaction of deferred timers.
  - Added a new 'handleTimeoutEvent' to Interface B.
  - Corrected a parameter ordering bug with net-level input params.
  - Added 'codelets' functionality - the ability to associate an executable parcel
    of code to an automated task, which will run when the task is enabled. An example
    codelet, 'ShellExecution', executes an external program on the client machine.
  - Refactored/improved/standardised the operation of Interface_Client, the foundation
    of data passing across the interfaces, with some flow-on refactoring of interfaces
    A, B & E.
  - Fixed a bug which was causing an exception if an xml 'escaped' character was
    entered in a text field on a dynamically generated form.
  - A workitem can now be passed to a 'custom form' (a specially designed form) for
    display and editing, rather than use the default dynamically generated form. The
    custom form may be jsp, jsf, php, .net or anything else that can receive an xml
    description of a workitem and use it to populate fields.
  - Increased default session times to 60 mins (from 30).
  - Relocated and refactored persistence restore code from YEngine to a new
    discrete 'YEngineRestorer' class.
  - Fixed a bug with data validation when executing a specification that called the
    yawlWSinvoker service.
  - Corrected some of the old examples so that they will all now execute successfully.
  - Enhanced resource event logging to capture all resource status changes.
  - Refactored/cleaned build.xml and the way the engine war file is built (so that it
    no longer contains superfluous classes).
  - Updated various third party jars to their latest versions.


3. CURRENT KNOWN LIMITATIONS
----------------------------
   This beta update version ships with the current *known* limitations listed below.
   They will be addressed shortly and will be resolved in the final production release.

   - The resource service's worklist and admin pages render correctly in all tested
     browsers (Firefox, Opera and Safari on Win & OSX) *except* Microsoft Internet
     Explorer.

   - The dynamic forms generated for workitems in the resource service's worklist do not
     yet support data schemas with simple type enumerations and restrictions.

   - There is an occasional issue in dynamic forms containing complex types that allow
     users to dynamically the increase the number of instances, where fields are not
     replicated correctly if data has previously been input into some of the fields.

   - The 'New Instance' button on the Started work queue, which provides for the
     dynamic creation of new workitem instances for multiple atomic tasks that allow
     dynamic creation, is not currently operational (ie. it does nothing).

                      YAWL Release 2.0 (beta) 30/05/2008
                      ==================================

This is the beta release of the YAWL Environment (version 2.0). A final 2.0 release
is expected in the short term, so this beta release should be considered a true 'beta':
released with a view to have any remaining issues, shortcomings and bugs identified and
resolved before the final release.

Please read through the list of new features and current known limitations below. More
detailed information will be released as it becomes available.

This release comes with a new installer package (for Windows installations) that easily
installs all the required software. Alternately, the install can be done manually by
copying the war files to tomcat/webapps directory as per previous versions.

QUICK START: After installation, start Tomcat and point a browser to
             http://localhost:8080/resourceService


1. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
  * Tomcat 5.5.25 or higher
  * Java 5 (1.5) or higher


2. NEW FEATURES
---------------
   ENGINE: The core YAWL engine is more robust, and supports several new features:

     - A task may be 'marked' as requiring human resources (a manual task - see the
       Resource Service below), or not (an automated task). When enabled, an automated
       task is immediately started and completed, with any XQueries on output parameters
       performed. The final release will include the ability for automated tasks to have
       'codelets' designated and executed during their processing.

     - A task may be extended with a timer, which can be set to be triggered either on
       enablement (ie. when a workitem is created) or on executing (ie. when a workitem
       is started), and to expire either after a specified duration or at a specified
       date and time. On expiry, a 'manual' task will auto-complete and an event will be
       generated by the engine for services to take action (if required). If the task
       is of 'automated' type, the timer will act as a delay (processing of an
       automated task is delayed until the timer expires). A net-level variable may
       be specified so that, at runtime, it receives a timer trigger type and expiry
       time or duration, which can be used by a later task (or tasks) to set its
       timer parameters - late binding of timer information.

     - A task or a decomposition may have 'extended attributes' added to its
       specification, which are passed through the engine to interested services to
       interpret as required. For example, attributes can be passed through to forms
       that describe how certain fields should be displayed.

     - A new interface, Interface E, has been created to provide a link to the engine's
       process logs, and contains a number of methods for interrogating the log tables.
       The structure of the log tables has been completely revamped to better capture
       process events.

     - For developers, the WorkItemRecord object has been expanded to provide much
       more information about a workitem to custom services.

     - A new specification schema has been developed to include the new features of
       YAWL 2.0, but the 2.0 engine is completely backwards-compatible and will execute
       process specifications developed under any and all previous YAWL versions.


   RESOURCE SERVICE: To support resourcing, a new Resource Service has been designed
   and implemented. The service has been created as a standard YAWL custom service, so
   that resourcing decisions are completely removed from the core engine - the engine
   has no knowledge of how a workitem is resourced. The service incorporates an
   integrated worklist handler and administrative tool, and provides direct support for
   38 of the 43 identified resource patterns (the remaining 5 refer to a 'case
   handling' paradigm). Full documentation will follow soon (but see the 'YAWL EDITOR
   v2.0 USER MANUAL' for some details). Features:

     - resources (participants and/or roles) can be allocated to tasks at design time,
       or can be late-bound at runtime, to form a 'distribution set' for each task.

     - certain filters and constraints may be applied to a distribution set, based on
       organisational groupings, positions and capabilities (or skillsets). Tasks can
       also be constrained so that they are allocated to the same user as a previous
       task (retain familiar), or not allocated to the same user as a previous task
       (four-eyes principle).

     - different allocation strategies may be applied to the set to choose a
       particular participant, including (by default) round robin, shortest queue,
       random choice, and historical (logged) data such as 'who hasn't done this for the
       longest time?'.

     - a user now has four workqueues: Offered, Allocated, Started and Suspended. Which
       queue a workitem arrives on depends on resourcing strategies applied to the
       workitem. Workitems can be manipulated via these queues (depending on 
       authorisations), for example a workitem may be delegated, reallocated (either
       with or without current data-state changes), skipped, chained, piled and so on.

     - a task may specify that it is to be displayed to the user via a 'custom form'
       designed specifically for the task, or be displayed via a dynamically
       generated form. The dynamic form generation is completely encapsulated within the
       resource service and does not rely on third party screen generation libraries
       (such as XForms). See 'customformtest.jsp' in the resourceService jsp files for
       an example of a simple custom form.

     - admin pages are provided to manipulate organisational data.

     - privileges (authorisations) can be applied to users and to particular tasks.

     - all resourcing actions are logged in process logs completely separate from
       those of the engine.

     - several 'pluggable' interfaces are provided:
         * org data can be provided from any data source through an 'OrgDataSouce'
           interface.
         * constraints, filters and allocation strategies can be added at any time.
         * a 'resource' interface provides resourcing data to (authorised) custom
           services.
         * a 'workqueue' interface provides full access to the work queue and routing
           framework to (authorised) services, so for example other worklist handlers
           can be implemented.


   YAWL PROCESS EDITOR: A new version of the YAWL Process Editor (2.0 beta) has been
   released and should be used to design new processes for the new engine version.


3. DEPRECATED SERVICES
----------------------
   A zip is provided in the distribution that contains 3 deprecated wars:

    - WORKLIST: Replaced by the resource service's integrated workist.
    - YAWLXFORMS: No longer required (the resource service generates its own forms).
    - TIMESERVICE: No longer required, since tasks can now have their own inbuilt timers.

   The deprecated services are still operational and may be used if desired. For
   example, the old worklist (which needs YawlXForms to run) can still be used to
   view and manage processes (but of course without any resourcing capabilities), and
   the time service can be used as before, especially where old process definitions
   rely on it.

   With the final 2.0 release, these services will be compiled one last time and
   released as deprecated services, and their source code will be moved from the
   YAWL codebase.

   Note: The old ADMINTOOL package has been superseded by the admin facilities of the
   Resource Service. AdminTool was no longer compatible with the engine and has been
   removed from the codebase.


4. CURRENT KNOWN LIMITATIONS
----------------------------
   This beta version ships with the current *known* limitations listed below. All will
   be resolved in the final release.

   - The resource service's worklist and admin pages render correctly in all tested
     browsers (Firefox, Opera and Safari on Win & OSX) *except* Microsoft Internet
     Explorer.

   - The dynamic forms generated for workitems in the resource service's worklist do not
     yet support data schema's with simple type enumerations and restrictions.

   - There is an occasional issue in dynamic forms containing complex types that allow
     users to dynamically the increase the number of instances, where fields are not
     replicated correctly if data has previously been input into some of the fields.

   - The 'New Instance' button on the Started work queue, which provides for the
     dynamic creation of new workitem instances for multiple atomic tasks that allow
     dynamic creation, is not currently operational (ie. it does nothing).


   The YAWL EDITOR currently has these known limitations:

   - late-binding of resourcing information to a net-level variable doesn't work
     correctly.

   - in the Resources Wizard if another application is maximized on the foreground, the
     dialogs for resource managing disappear, thus losing the data that has been
     currently inserted in the  dialogs.

   - in the Resources Wizard, permission to pile tasks cannot be given for a task.

   - once a decomposition for a task is set to manual, there is no way in the editor to
     set it back to automated.

   - timer expiry can only be expressed as a duration, but not as a specific date-time.

   - late-binding of timer data to a net variable is not supported.

   - the versioning of specifications does not work. It is not automatically increased
     in the Export Spec dialog box, and any change in the version number is not reflected
     in the exported specification.

   - if an org model does not feature any participants but only roles, the wizard does
     not work.

   - when "retain familiar" and "4-eye principle" are ticked in Step 3 of the wizard,
     they remain ticked, no matter if they are unticked, i.e. it is not possible to undo
     this choice

   - an exception is thrown in the editor if a name uses the "&" symbol. As a result, the
     resource wizard does not show up.

   - on export, an exception is thrown if the queries of a MI task are not specified.
     The XML is exported as an empty file (it only contains the word NULL).

   - when a net is created with one automated task (ie. Manage Resourcing is not
     selected). On exporting to xml, the xml correctly marked the decomposition as
     'automated'. If then a second task is added and set with some basic resourcing
     requirements, then exported, the decompositions for BOTH tasks are now set to
     'manual', even though the first task was not touched.

   - it is not possible to remove a decomposition from a task unless the task is removed
     from the net.

   - when a decomposition is changed, the label is not updated.
