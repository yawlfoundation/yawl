# This set of properties relate to the LDAP connection parameters
#
# The LDAP context factory
contextfactory=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory

# LDAP hostname and port number
host=localhost
port=10389

# the name of the admin user, its password, and the authentication type
adminusername=uid=admin,ou=system
adminpassword=secret
authentication=simple

# the 'top' binding for the user set
binding=ou=users,ou=system

# the maximum size limit for reading entries, so that entries will be loaded in 'chunks'
# of no more than the maximum size limit given. This value may be less than or
# equal to (but must not greater than) the maximum size limit configured for the
# LDAP server. If no value is given, or if the value given is zero or less, no limit
# will be used for reading entries (ie. loading of all entries in a single call to the
# LDAP server will be attempted). A value is required for this parameter only if there
# are more user entries than the maximum size limit set on the server.
maxSizeLimit=500   

# set to true if user/password authentication is to be delegated to the LDAP
# server, or false if the password is to be mapped to the Resource Service's
# user object so that authentication is handled inside the service.
delegateauthentication=true

# the matching LDAP attribute names for each user (on the right).

# These last two are optional - leave the right hand value blank if not required
#
# The attribute name for the user's password. This attribute is required if user
# authentication is to be handled directly by the Resource Service. It may be left
# blank if authentication is to be delegated to the LDAP host.
password=

# a boolean attribute that determines if the user has admin access to the YAWL system
administrator=

# Roles Attributes
# the name of the Role attribute name.
